TITLE:
      Efficacy and Safety of Lacidipine in Chronic Stable Angina
SUMMARY:
      The aim of this study was to explore whether lacidipine at doses of 2 mg, 4 mg and 6 mg
      decreased the symptoms of angina, compared to placebo in patients with chronic stable angina
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 80 years

          -  History of stable, exertional angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             functional class II to III) for at least 3 months duration prior to enrolment in the
             study

          -  Patients not currently receiving treatment with antianginal medication (other than
             short-acting nitrates)

          -  Between visits 2 and 3 two treadmill exercise tests, demonstrating ≥ 0.1 mV of
             horizontal or down sloping ST-segment depression, must be carried out. The difference
             in symptom-limited exercise duration between these two tests must not exceed 20%

          -  Total treadmill exercise duration > 3 minutes (i.e. stage 2 or above on a standard
             Bruce protocol)

          -  Coronary artery disease, preferably (not mandatory) documented by a history of proven
             myocardial infarction and/or coronary angiography indicating ≥ 50% reduction in
             luminal diameter of one or more coronary arteries or their primary branches

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to enrolment in the study

          -  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass
             surgery within 6 months

          -  Other types of angina (variant, unstable)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood
             pressure > 100 mmHg)

          -  Resting heart rate < 50 bpm or > 100 bpm

          -  Significant valvular heart disease

          -  Heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma with clinical symptoms requiring
             regular medication

          -  Significant arrhythmia (since this may interfere with the interpretation of the
             electrocardiogram) including Wolff Parkinson-White syndrome, atrial fibrillation,
             atrial flutter, sick sinus syndrome, significant Atrio-Ventricular heart block,
             intraventricular conduction defect (QRS > 0.12 seconds) ventricular pre-excitation,
             bundle branch block, the presence of a pace-maker, the presence of an implanted
             automatic defibrillator, uncorrected hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/litre)

          -  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus

          -  Significant liver disease (Aspartate Aminotransferase or Alanine Aminotransferase >
             twice the upper limit of reference range)

          -  Significant renal disease (creatinine > 1.5 x upper limit of reference range)

          -  Any clinical condition which in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the
             safe fulfilment of the protocol and the safe administration of trial medication

          -  Inability to perform repeated exercise testing due to extra-cardiac reasons

          -  Concomitant treatment with any other anti-anginal medication, whether or not
             prescribed for this indication (e.g. calcium channel blockers, β-blockers or
             long-acting nitrates)

          -  Concomitant treatment with anti-arrhythmic medication, digitalis or tricyclic
             anti-depressants or other agents known to affect ST-segment morphology

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational drug

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of child bearing potential

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial within 2 months of enrolment

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

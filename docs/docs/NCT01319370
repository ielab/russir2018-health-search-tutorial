TITLE:
      Effectiveness and Safety of Minoxidil Foam Versus Placebo Foam for Androgenetic Alopecia
SUMMARY:
      The current study aims to show efficacy of twice daily application of 5% Minoxidil Topical
      Foam (MTF) formulation compared to placebo in the temple region of male patients with
      androgenetic alopecia after 24 weeks as well as to gain long-term data on the efficacy and
      safety of 5% MTF in male subjects with AGA in temple and vertex region, over a period of 2
      years. Objective and subjective efficacy measures will be compared to baseline. Moreover,
      all patients will get the equal treatment and measurements in the vertex region to enable
      comparison of the efficacy of 5% Minoxidil Topical Foam in the temples not only to baseline
      but also to vertex region. Additionally safety assessments will be performed throughout the
      whole study.

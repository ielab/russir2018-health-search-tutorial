TITLE:
      Effects of L-thyroxine Replacement on Serum Lipid and Atherosclerosis in Hypothyroidism
SUMMARY:
      Hypothyroidism is a common clinical entity which is often complicated by dyslipidemia. It is
      also reported increased risk for incidence of atherosclerosis and resulting coronary heart
      disease(CHD), heart failure(HF) and cardiovascular(CV) death. The effect of L-thyroxine
      replacement treatment on serum lipid and atherosclerosis is controversial in hypothyroid
      patients, especially in those with mild or moderate subclinical hypothyroidism. The present
      study was designed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement was effective in improving
      serum lipid profiles and retarding atherosclerosis progress.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  40~75 years old

          -  Diagnosis of overt or subclinical hypothyroidism in two occasions with a minimum
             interval period of three months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Severe hepatic or renal dysfunction

          -  Psychiatric disabilities, acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, chronic
             respiratory diseases, familiar hypercholesterolemia, malignancy, cholelithiasis,
             pancreatitis, bowel diseases and other disorders influencing lipid and bile acid
             metabolism

          -  Taking lipid-lowering agents and other drugs influencing thyroid function, lipid and
             bile acid metabolism

          -  Obviously poor compliance.

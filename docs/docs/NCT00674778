TITLE:
      Prospective Registry on Vascular Access in Interventions in Lazio Region
SUMMARY:
      Previous randomised studies showed that radial artery catheterisation for percutaneous
      cardiovascular procedures has a superior safety profile than femoral access, however the
      confirmation of these benefits in the real world by a large, specific, observational study
      is still lacking.

      We endeavoured to assess the access site-related outcomes of any percutaneous cardiovascular
      procedure by designing a prospective registry monitoring a consecutive sample of patients in
      a short period of time at nine Roman hospitals reflecting the contemporary state of health
      care.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients undergoing any percutaneous cardiovascular procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients already enrolled in other clinical trials

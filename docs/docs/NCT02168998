TITLE:
      Cortisol Measurement During Intravenous Access With a Medical Clown
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the presence of a medical clown in a
      pediatric emergency department procedure room would reduce children's anxiety. The
      investigators hypothesize that this positive influence will be expressed as lower levels of
      the stress hormone (Cortisol) in the blood.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients needing venous blood sampling or insertion of an intravenous canula

          -  Normal development according to parents

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Critically ill children (e.g. shock, respiratory distress or failure)

          -  Children whose blood work or intravenous canula must be obtained rapidly for
             therapeutic reasons (e.g. antibiotic administration in a patient with severe
             bacterial infections)

          -  Known adrenal or pituitary disease

          -  Children who have received glucocorticoids during the preceeding six weeks

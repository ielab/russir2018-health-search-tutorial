TITLE:
      Postoperative Respiratory Depression After Cardiac Surgery
SUMMARY:
      Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is associated with postoperative respiratory
      depression. In this study we aimed at investigating perioperative parameters that could
      predict the nadir of postoperative respiratory function impairment.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a principal revascularization option for
      ischemic heart disease and the principal modality for invasive treatment of coronary artery
      disease. Postoperative pulmonary complications are the most frequent and significant
      contributor to length of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. The objective of this
      study is to search for perioperative parameters that could predict the degree of impairment
      of respiratory function after CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients of both sexes older than 18 years submitted to CABG with CPB, presence of
             coronary disease confirmed by coronary angiography, use of the left internal thoracic
             artery and/or saphena, patients who remained in spontaneous ventilation on the first
             postoperative day, absence of chronic or acute pulmonary disease, and giving written
             informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  intraoperative change of the surgical technique, surgical complications or
             complications occurring in the ICU, emergency reoperation, renal failure, failure to
             agree to continue in the study, presence of other types of heart disease, and
             presence of pulmonary diseases.

TITLE:
      BES, EES, and ZES-R in Real World Practice
SUMMARY:
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the rate of device-oriented composite
      consisted of cardiac death, myocardial infarction not clearly attributable to a nontarget
      vessel, and clinically indicated target lesion revascularization among the patients treated
      with EES, ZES-R, or BES at 24-month clinical follow-up post-index procedure. Trial end
      points are summarized in Table I. The hypothesis is that BES is equivalent to EES or BES is
      equivalent to ZES-R at the primary end point.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Previous randomized trials have shown the superior efficacy of drug-eluting stents (DES),
      such as sirolimus-eluting stent (SES, CYPHER, Cordis, US), paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES,
      TAXUS, Boston Scientific, US), and zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES, Endeavor, Medtronic, US)
      compared with bare metal stents (BMS) by reducing neointimal hyperplasia, late luminal loss,
      and angiographic restenosis leading to decreased target lesion revascularization.
      Unfortunately, restenosis still occurs and late stent thrombosis can develop by delaying
      endoluminal healing or by chronic inflammation.Accordingly, development of new DES is
      required to improve efficacy by reducing revascularization and safety by reducing the risk
      of stent thrombosis. With the improvement of polymer, drug, and the platform, the 2nd
      generation DES, including everolimus-eluting stent (EES, Xience V or Xience Prime, Abbott,
      USA), zotarolimus-eluting stent with biolinx polymer (ZES-R, Endeavor Resolute or Endeavor
      Resolute Integrity, Medtronic, USA), and biolimus-eluting stent (BES, BioMatrix or Biomatrix
      Flex, Biosensors, USA), have been shown to be superior or non-inferior in safety and
      efficacy trials compared with 1st generation DES.

      However, it is difficult to know if there are any differences in efficacy and safety between
      the EES, the ZES-R, and the BES, in real world practice due to the lack of data comparing
      these three 2nd generation DES directly. This study provides the evidence for the CHOICE of
      stent when physicians are treating patients by percutaneous coronary intervention.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria

          -  Age > 19 years

          -  Subject is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment
             alternatives of receiving the drug-eluting stent(s) and he/she or his/her legally
             authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study
             related procedure

          -  Subject must have significant stenosis (>50% by visual estimate) on a native or
             in-stent coronary artery

          -  Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable, unstable angina,
             recent infarction, acute myocardial infarction, positive functional study or a
             reversible changes in the ECG consistent with ischemia). In subjects with coronary
             artery stenosis >75%, evidence of myocardial ischemia does not have to be documented

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following
             medications: heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, biolimus A9,
             everolimus, zotarolimus, stainless steel, cobalt chromium, contrast media (Patients
             with documented sensitivity to contrast media, which can be effectively premedicated
             with steroid and diphenhydramine may be enrolled. However, those with true
             anaphylaxis to prior contrast media should not be enrolled.)

          -  Subject in use of systemic (intravenous) biolimus A9, everolimus or zotarolimus
             within 12 months.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative,
             who possibly plans to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study

          -  Subject planned an elective surgical procedure that would necessitate interruption of
             antiplatelet during the first 12 months post enrollment

          -  Subject with non-cardiac co-morbid condition with life expectancy < 2 year or that
             may result in protocol non-compliance (per site investigator's medical judgment)

          -  Subject with cardiogenic shock at presentation

          -  Subject who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational
             study, who have not completed the primary end point follow-up period

TITLE:
      Ivabradine Versus Beta-blockers in the Treatment of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia
SUMMARY:
      The aim of this study is to prospectively compare the effectiveness and safety of ivabradine
      and beta-blockers in the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a non-paroxysmal arrhythmia, characterized by a
      persistently high sinus heart rate (HR) and/or an exaggerated HR response to minimal
      exertion, and can be responsible for palpitations, asthenia, chest pain, dizziness and
      syncope, which can be highly invalidating. Conventional treatment of IST, targeted to
      symptoms control, mainly consists on β-blockers. However, these drugs are often insufficient
      or not well tolerated because of side effects (mostly hypotension) that usually limit the
      administered dose. Ivabradine, a sinus rate lowering agent currently employed in Europe in
      the treatment of stable angina and chronic heart failure, has recently been demonstrated to
      be effective and safe in the treatment of IST by a few case reports and clinical trials. A
      randomized clinical trial comparing ivabradine to β-blockers has not be performed yet.

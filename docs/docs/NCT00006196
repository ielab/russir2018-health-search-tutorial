TITLE:
      The Relationship Between Vitamin D, Fingernail Thickness and Bone Density
SUMMARY:
      Vitamin D deficiency is common in the elderly and contributes to the increased incidence of
      falls, hip fracture and depression in this population. An unknown number of elderly have
      vitamin D resistance resulting in a functional vitamin D deficiency state. Because there are
      no simple procedures or blood tests that identify vitamin D resistance, its prevalence and
      contribution to disability in the elderly is unknown. Our inability to screen for this
      condition precludes our ability to initiate and monitor treatment.

      Previous studies indicate that fingernail thickness correlates with vitamin D status and may
      therefore provide a simple cost effective procedure to not only identify patients with
      vitamin D deficiency but also, those with vitamin D resistance. This procedure may also
      provide a way to monitor an individual's response to treatment.

      This study is designed to demonstrate the association between fingernail thickness and
      vitamin D status.

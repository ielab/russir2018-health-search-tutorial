TITLE:
      Use of Amplified Sound Signal to Identify Presence of Carotid and Femoral Stenosis
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of the study is to test a new amplified stethoscope(AudioDoc) that can detect
      the presence of bruit by using an acoustic signal to represent the bruit. This pilot study
      will address two questions: is there a detectable difference in recorded sound signal of
      carotid and femoral bruit when compared to sound signals captured when there is no bruit
      present; is the use of a visual recorded signal more accurate in identifying carotid and
      femoral bruit when compared to traditional auscultation with a regular stethoscope and
      ultrasound.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Recorded signals are stored on a laptop computer. The signals later undergo Fourier analysis
      are then compared to the findings on carotid ultrasoud as to degree of stenosis. Subjects
      with high grade stenosis in which no bruit was ascultated but in which carotid ultrasound
      data suggests a bruit may be present are studied for soft /inaudible bruits. When available,
      data will be correlated to CT/conventional angiographic studies.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age 19-90 years

          -  having clinical ultrasound evaluation of carotid or femoral artery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  under age 19; over age 90 years

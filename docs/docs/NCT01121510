TITLE:
      Hemostatic Closure of Femoral Artery Access Site, Using the QuickClose Design 9 System
SUMMARY:
      The QuickClose Design 9 is a prospective, non randomized study, to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the QuickClose design 9 closure device.

      patient undergoing a diagnostic or therapeutic angiogram procedure will be treated with the
      QuickClose Design 9. Patients will be monitored until 30 days after the procedure.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      the primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major complications related to method for
      achieving hemostasis at the puncture site. the secondary safety endpoints is the incidence
      of minor complications related to method for achieving hemostasis at the puncture site. the
      primary efficacy endpoints are time to hemostasis, time to ambulation and time to discharge.
      the secondary efficacy endpoints are device and procedure success

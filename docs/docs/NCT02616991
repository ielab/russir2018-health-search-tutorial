TITLE:
      Computed Tomography CT Venography During Postpartum Venous Thromboembolism
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether systematically performing computed
      tomography (CT) venography (i.e a CT acquisition of the pelvis and of the lower limbs,
      during the venous phase of opacification) in addition to thoracic CT angiography in women
      with suspected postpartum pulmonary embolism (PE) results in a gain in venous
      thromboembolism detection rate.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal death during postpartum in
      developed countries; Thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the first-line
      diagnostic test for PE suspicion, but has a 20 to 35% rate of inconclusiveness during
      pregnancy and postpartum, 2 to 3 times higher than that of the general population. CT
      venography (CTV) consists in a delayed CT acquisition of the abdomen, pelvis and lower
      limbs, 3 minutes after starting contrast administration. It can be used for detecting deep
      venous thrombosis (DVT), the source of emboli in most PEs. The investigators hypothesized
      most postpartum PEs are due to pelvic vein thrombosis and that detecting such pelvic DVT by
      performing systematic CTV could increase the overall venous thromboembolism (VTE) detection.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) during the first 6 weeks
             postpartum, without any sign of severe PE (shock, hypotension), referred for CT
             angiography

          -  Absence of contraindication to iodinated contrast medium injection

          -  Age > 18 years

          -  Health insurance

          -  Possibility to have 3-month follow-up

          -  Obtention of written informed consent (ability to give consent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anticoagulation at therapeutic dosage for another reason than the suspicion of PE

          -  New pregnancy (Î²HCG positive before CT angiography)

          -  Contrast medium extravasation during injection

          -  CTA or CTV not performed according to the study requirements

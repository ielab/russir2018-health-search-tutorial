TITLE:
      Cerebral Blood Flow Changes in People With Obesity After Glucose Consumption
SUMMARY:
      This study evaluates the hypothesis that a meal constituted of only glucose produces
      differences in the brain blood flow in people with obesity that are not observed in people
      without obesity. These changes, at least in part, could explain the mechanisms involved in
      maintenance or development of obesity.

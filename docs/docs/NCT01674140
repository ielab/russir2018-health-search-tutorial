TITLE:
      S1207 Hormone Therapy With or Without Everolimus in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer
SUMMARY:
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      tamoxifen citrate, goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, anastrozole, letrozole, or
      exemestane, may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes.
      Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. It is not yet know whether hormone therapy is more effective when given with or
      without everolimus in treating breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial studies how well giving hormone therapy together
      with or without everolimus work in treating patients with breast cancer.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare whether the addition of one year of everolimus (10 mg daily) to standard
           adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in patients
           with high-risk, hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, and human epidermal growth factor
           receptor (HER)2-negative breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare whether the addition of one year of everolimus to standard adjuvant
           endocrine therapy improves overall survival (OS) and distant recurrence-free survival
           (DRFS) in this patient population.

        -  To evaluate the safety, toxicities, and tolerability of one year of everolimus in
           combination with standard adjuvant endocrine therapy and to compare it with standard
           adjuvant endocrine therapy plus placebo in this patient population.

        -  To determine whether the benefit of one year of everolimus use in addition to standard
           adjuvant endocrine therapy varies by recurrence score (RS), nodal status, or other
           commonly used prognostic factors.

        -  To evaluate adherence to 1-year treatment of everolimus in comparison to placebo in
           addition to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy in this patient population.

        -  To collect specimens in order to evaluate biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy.
           (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk level
      (node-negative and recurrence score [RS] > 25 in the primary tumor, and a tumor measuring ≥
      2 cm in greatest diameter treated with adjuvant therapy vs 1-3 positive lymph nodes and RS >
      25 treated with adjuvant therapy vs ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes [any RS value] treated with
      adjuvant therapy vs ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes [any RS value] prior to or after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive an approved endocrine therapy comprising tamoxifen citrate*,
           goserelin acetate** or leuprolide acetate**, or aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole,
           letrozole, or exemestane) for 2-5 years. Patients also receive a placebo orally (PO)
           daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an approved endocrine therapy regimen as in arm I. Patients
           also receive everolimus PO daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Men receive tamoxifen citrate PO for 5 years.

      NOTE: **Goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate is given if patient is or becomes
      postmenopausal.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected for biomarker studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then yearly thereafter for 10 years.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma
             with positive estrogen (ER)- and/or progesterone-receptor (PR) status, and negative
             human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2, for whom standard adjuvant endocrine
             therapy is planned

               -  ER and PR positivity must be assessed according to American Society of Clinical
                  Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines as either ER
                  or PR ≥ 1% positive nuclear staining

               -  HER2 test result negativity must be assessed as per ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines
                  using IHC, ISH or both.

        HER2 is negative if a single test (or all tests) performed in a tumor specimen show:

          1. IHC negative (0 or 1+)

          2. ISH negative using single probe or dual probe. If IHC is 2+, evaluation for gene
             amplification (ISH) must be performed and the ISH must be negative; ISH is not
             required if IHC is 0 or 1+.

        HER2 equivocal is not eligible.

          -  Patients must not have metastatic breast cancer (stage IV disease); patients with
             multifocal, multicentric, and synchronous bilateral, and primary inflammatory breast
             cancers are allowed

               -  Multifocal disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer < 2 cm from the
                  largest lesion within the same breast quadrant

               -  Multicentric disease is defined as more than one invasive cancer ≥ 2 cm from the
                  largest lesion within the same breast quadrant or more than one lesion in
                  different quadrants

               -  Synchronous bilateral disease is defined as invasive breast cancer with positive
                  lymph nodes (axillary or intramammary) in at least one breast, diagnosed within
                  30 days of each other

          -  Patients must be high risk by belonging to one of the following risk groups:

               -  Completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and pathologically negative axillary nodes,
                  and a tumor measuring ≥ 2 cm in greatest diameter, and an Oncotype DX®
                  recurrence score (RS) > 25 (completed as standard of care). Patients with
                  micrometastases as the only nodal involvement (pN1mi) are eligible, and will be
                  categorized as node-negative.

               -  Completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, and pathologically 1-3 positive lymph
                  nodes, and either an Oncotype DX® RS > 25 (screened via S1007 or otherwise) or
                  tumor tissue with pathological Grade III following local practice. If Oncotype
                  DX is done, then RS must be > 25. If the test is not done, but the patient has
                  Grade III disease then the patient is eligible and Oncotype DX does not need to
                  be performed.

               -  Completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and pathologically 4 or more positive lymph
                  nodes.

               -  Completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 1 or more positive nodes
                  pathologically determined prior to or after chemotherapy

             with negative margins and appropriate axillary staging; a negative margin is defined
             as no evidence of tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at the line of resection;
             additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins

               -  Patients who had breast-conserving surgery must have completed whole-breast
                  radiation; use of regional nodal-basin radiation will be at the discretion of

                  population of patients

               -  Patients must be registered no sooner than 21 days after completion of radiation
                  therapy and must have recovered (≤ grade 1) from any of the effects of radiation

                  allowed provided that the patient completed either whole-breast or chest-wall
                  radiation and the primary tumor is < 5 cm

               -  All patients with ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes must have completed ALND (with or
                  without prior sentinel-node biopsy)

                  includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or
                  with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation; corresponding procedures for men
                  include castration, vasectomy, and barrier-contractive devices

               -  If at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually

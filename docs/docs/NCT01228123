TITLE:
      Clinical Trial Comparing Continuous Versus Intermittent Hemodialysis in ICU Patients
SUMMARY:
      The mortality of acute renal failure (ARF) remains to be high (around 60-70%) despite
      manifold improvements in ICU care. At present, it is not clear if the method chosen for
      renal replacement therapy, i.e. intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) or continuous
      haemofiltration (CVVH), might impact on the outcome of these patients. For this purpose, a
      prospective randomised clinical study of the effect of continuous versus intermittent renal
      replacement therapy on the mortality and outcome of acute renal failure will be performed.

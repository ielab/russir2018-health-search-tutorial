TITLE:
      Comparison of the FemoSeal速 Arterial Closure Device to Manual Compression After Coronary Angiography
SUMMARY:
      Is the FemoSeal速 closure device safer and more comfortable than manual compression for
      femoral artery access closure after coronary angiography?
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Access site complication after coronary angiography is still a challenge in everyday
      practice. The FemoSeal速 closure device has proven very safe as shown in the swedish SCAAR
      registry. This study is aimed to investigate, in a randomized design, if the FemoSeal速 has
      an advantage in safety and efficacy over manual compression.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing femoral access coronary angiography

          -  Patient must be competent for providing informed, written consent

          -  Only 6F sheath

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Percutaneous coronary intervention

          -  Intra coronary measurements (FFR, IVUS, OCT, NIR)

          -  Groin hematoma before closure

          -  Pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula

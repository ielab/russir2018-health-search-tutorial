TITLE:
      The Use of Virtual Reality for the Gait Training of Elderly Fallers
SUMMARY:
      The study aims to investigate the efficacy of gait training using virtual reality to
      decrease the risk of falls in elderly idiopathic fallers. The investigator hypothesize that
      training with virtual reality would increase the ability to perform in the "real world"
      environment and decrease the risk of falls in elderly adults.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The study is a prospective single-blinded randomized control study with repeated measures at
      pre intervention, post intervention and follow up at 3 and 6 months post intervention. For
      six months after termination of the intervention, all subjects will fill out a log book in
      which they will write the occurrence and date of falls. total time of participation in the
      study will be 8 months.

TITLE:
      MYOCARDIAL SILENT INFARCTIONS AND FIBROSIS IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (CHOLCOEUR)
SUMMARY:
      Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) at high cardiovascular risk may suffer from
      silent micro-infarctions (MI) before clinical coronary heart disease manifestations because
      of the lifetime exposure to elevated serum LDL-cholesterol levels.

      The study aims to demonstrate the higher prevalence of silent myocardial infarction in a
      population of asymptomatic patients with familial hypercholesterolemia at high
      cardiovascular risk in comparison to control patients using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
      sequences of delayed gadolinium enhancement.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      To demonstrate the higher prevalence of silent myocardial infarction in a population of
      asymptomatic patients with familial hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk in
      comparison to control patients, the protocol is the following:

        -  to enroll 75 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)

        -  to enroll 35 subjects without FH (control group)

        -  for each subject, to collect data from his medical file (blood test results) and to
           perform a cardiac and aortic MRI in order to evaluate the micro-infarction proportion.

      The study will be performed according to GCPs and with respect with french laws.

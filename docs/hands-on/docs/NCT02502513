TITLE:
      Prevention of Intrusive Memories and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms After Emergency Cesarean Section
SUMMARY:
      This pilot study aims to investigate the effects of a brief computerized intervention (the
      computer game "Tetris") on intrusive memories and other posttraumatic stress symptoms
      following an emergency cesarean section. Patients who have undergone an emergency cesarian
      section will be randomly allocated to either the brief computerized intervention or usual
      care within the first 6 hours following the operation. Participants will be followed up at
      one week and one month. It is predicted that participants given the brief computerized
      intervention will develop fewer intrusive memories and less severe clinical symptoms than
      those who are not. This will inform the potential future development of a simple
      computerized intervention to prevent distressing psychological symptoms after a traumatic
      event such as an emergency cesarean section.

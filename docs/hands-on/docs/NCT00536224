TITLE:
      Chest Pain Observation Unit Risk Reduction Trial
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief counseling intervention initiated
      in the chest pain observation unit has a significant impact upon the health attitudes
      (readiness to change) and cardiovascular risk-related behaviors (diet, exercise, and
      smoking) of emergency department patients.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Increasingly, emergency department patients for whom a non-ischemic etiology of ACS symptoms
      cannot be identified undergo further evaluation to rule out myocardial ischemia and
      appraisal of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in chest pain observation units (CPOUs).
      CPOU admission may represent a "teachable moment," but there has been little research on the
      effectiveness of brief, practical interventions for cardiovascular risk reduction in this
      population, despite the fact that the vast majority of these patients have at least one
      modifiable CRF and many do not receive regular primary care follow-up. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether a brief counseling intervention initiated in the CPOU has a
      significant impact upon health attitudes (readiness to change) and cardiovascular
      risk-related behaviors (diet, exercise, and smoking). Based on the Health Belief Model
      (HBM), the intervention is designed to provide patients with tailored information on their
      cardiovascular risk, to negotiate goals for change, and to build problem-solving skills. All
      participants who are admitted to the CPOU for evaluation of ACS symptoms will be randomized
      to brief intervention (face-to-face counseling in the CPOU, coupled with telephone
      counseling at 4 weeks) or to minimal intervention (booklet with general information on CRFs)
      after a negative initial troponin measurement. We will conduct a baseline survey and
      follow-up telephone interviews at 2- and 6-month to assess stage of change and CRF-related
      behaviors. Both adjusted and unadjusted multivariable analyses will be performed to
      determine the intervention effect (using an intention-to-treat approach). We will also use
      mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which the intervention is mediated by HBM
      constructs (e.g., perceived susceptibility to cardiovascular adverse events, perceived
      benefit of risk reduction, perceived barriers, self-efficacy). The proposed trial will
      evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering brief interventions for
      cardiovascular risk reduction in the CPOU setting, will provide insight into mechanisms of
      behavior change in these patients, and will guide the development of future case management
      interventions.

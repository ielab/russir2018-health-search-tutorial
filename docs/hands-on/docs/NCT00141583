TITLE:
      The Renin-Angiotensin System in Essential Hypertension
SUMMARY:
      Although ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers are effective blood pressure
      lowering agents, the exact mechanisms by which these agents lower BP are still not fully
      understood. This study aims to compare the blood pressure and hormonal responses (plasma
      renin activity and aldosterone) to the ACE inhibitor enalapril and ARB candesartan in
      individuals with mild essential hypertension.

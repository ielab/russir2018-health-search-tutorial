TITLE:
      Are There Protective Effects of Antioxidants, Calcium Channel Blocker and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Against Extracorporeal Shockwaves Lithotripsy Induced Renal Injury?
SUMMARY:
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the protective effects and mechanisms of
      antioxidants (vitamins A, C, E and Selenium), calcium channel blocker (Verapamil) and
      angiotensin receptor blocker (Lozartan) against shock wave induced renal injuries.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The protective effect will be evaluated via estimation of the changes in renal tubular
      enzyme (NGAL) and detection of albumen levels in urine. The mechanisms of protection will be
      investigated by estimation of renal perfusion and functional changes using dynamic MRI.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Well functioning kidney (serum creatinine <1.2 mg/dl).

          2. Solitary renal stone.

          3. Size: 25 mm or less in the largest diameter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications to ESWL

          2. Previous surgical treatment of renal stones.

          3. Congenital renal anomalies.

          4. Pediatric patients (age <18 years).

          5. Patients with Diabetes or hypertension

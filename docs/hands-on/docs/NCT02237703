TITLE:
      Kappa Opioid Receptor Imaging in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
SUMMARY:
      This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure kappa opioid receptors
      (KOR) in the brains of individuals with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      The investigators propose to recruit 45 drug-naÃ¯ve individuals, N=15 patients with PTSD,
      N=15 trauma-exposed, but asymptomatic healthy control subjects (TC) and N=15 non-trauma
      exposed healthy control subjects (HC) to participate in one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      and one PET study. The investigators will also carefully document trauma history, and
      collect behavioral and neuroendocrine measures to provide a more integrative view on the
      neurobiology of PTSD and its phenotype. The investigators predict PTSD will show greater
      carbon - 11 (11C)[11C]LY2795050 volume of distribution (VT) (i.e. KOR binding) values than
      control populations in an a priori defined PTSD circuit.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion criteria for patients with PTSD:

          1. age 18-55 years old

          2. currently diagnosed with PTSD and symptomatic with a Clinician-Administered PTSD
             Scale (CAPS) score > 50.

        Exclusion criteria for patients with PTSD:

          1. any primary Axis I disorder other than PTSD (e.g. psychosis)

          2. medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, i.e.
             uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disorders

          3. a history of drug (including benzodiazepines (BZD)) dependence (Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) criteria) within 1 year of the study
             and lasting longer than 2 years, except for alcohol dependence

          4. current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing at screening or on the day of
             PET imaging study)

          5. current breast feeding

          6. use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day, or cannot abstain from smoking during the prescribed tests

          7. acute suicidal ideation or behavior, as defined by suicidal ideation and behavior
             during the 3-month period prior to enrollment in the study and while being enrolled
             in the study

          8. general MRI exclusion criteria, i.e. pacemakers, metals in the body

          9. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (due to possible neuropsychiatric effects);

         10. use of opioid medications within 2 weeks of the PET study

         11. having an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, increases the risks associated with participation in the study

         12. seriously claustrophobic

         13. blood donation within 8 weeks prior to the study.

        Inclusion criteria for Healthy Subjects:

          1. age 18-55 years old

          2. no personal or first-degree family history of any Axis I diagnosis.

        Exclusion criteria for Healthy Subjects:

          1. any history or current primary Axis I disorder

          2. medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, i.e.
             uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disorders

          3. a history of drug (including benzodiazepines [BZD]) dependence (DSM IV criteria)
             within 1 year of the study and lasting longer than 2 years, except for alcohol
             dependence

          4. current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing at screening or on the day of
             PET imaging study)

          5. current breast feeding

          6. use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day, or cannot abstain from smoking during the prescribed tests

          7. acute suicidal ideation or behavior, as defined by suicidal ideation and behavior
             during the 3-month period prior to enrollment in the study and while being enrolled
             in the study

          8. general MRI exclusion criteria, i.e. pacemakers, metals in the body

          9. HIV (due to possible neuropsychiatric effects)

         10. use of opioid medications within 2 weeks of the PET study

         11. having an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             increases the risks associated with participation in the study

         12. seriously claustrophobic

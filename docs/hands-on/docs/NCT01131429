TITLE:
      A Chinese Randomized Crossover Study of Erlotinib Versus Docetaxel/Cisplatin in Previously Untreated Stage IIIB/IV Lung Adenocarcinoma With EGFR Mutations
SUMMARY:
      Objective: the objective of this study in china is to clarify, whether the overall survival
      is different between previously untreated stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR
      mutations receiving first-line erlotinib plus second-line docetaxel/cisplatin and those
      receiving first-line docetaxel/cisplatin plus second-line erlotinib .
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients aged over 18 years

          -  Histologically proven lung adenocarcinoma

          -  clinical stage IIIB/IV

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Had no prior anticancer agent, radiation or surgical therapy for lung adenocarcinoma

          -  At least one measurable lesion (according to RECIST)

          -  Provision of written informed consent

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of malignant disease.

          -  Evidence of clinically active interstitial lung diseases (patients with chronic,
             stable, radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded)

          -  Expected life expectancy less than 2 months

          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             disease (e.g. unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal
             disease)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≥ 2.5 x
             ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases (or >5 x in presence of liver metastases)

          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
             it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding women (women of child¬bearing potential). Women of
             childbearing potential must practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent
             pregnancy.

TITLE:
      Singing Away the Blues: Assessing the Wellbeing of Mothers
SUMMARY:
      Post-natal depression (PND) is anticipated to affect 12.9% of new mothers with at least
      75,000 cases per year in the UK alone. However, despite this, there is currently a worrying
      lack of support for new mothers, with data suggesting that 64% of healthcare trusts in the
      UK do not have a strategy for treating PND, and flaws in the current pharmacological and
      psychological treatment models. Consequently, research into promising psychosocial
      interventions such as music is critical to developing new paradigms for treating PND.

      Singing away the Blues is an ambitious programme of research that investigates links between
      the mental health of women in the later stages of pregnancy and first 9 months post birth
      and their use of psychosocial interventions including music.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The study uses an online questionnaire to achieve a cross-sectional view of the mental
      health of women across England in the final stages of pregnancy and the first 9 months post
      birth, how much and in what ways music is used by these women, and whether there are any
      associations between music and mental health. The study aims to recruit 1,000 women to take
      the anonymous questionnaire. However, women who complete the questionnaire while still
      pregnant will be invited to complete three further questionnaires shortly post-birth and 3
      months later to gather longitudinal data to analyse change across pregnancy into post-birth
      (aiming for 500 of the 1,000 undertaking this repeated measurement).

      Phase A of the study will be open to NHS sites around England to take part.

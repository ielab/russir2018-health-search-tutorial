TITLE:
      The Effects of Inorganic Nitrate on Cardiac Muscle in Angina
SUMMARY:
      Previous studies have shown that interventions which modestly increase blood nitrite_
      improve skeletal muscle function on exercise while sparing oxygen, and have been also shown
      to open up the blood flow during periods of oxygen deprivation. Inorganic nitrate in the
      diet is absorbed into the bloodstream, concentrated and reduced by bacteria in the mouth to
      nitrite, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. .

      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of oral inorganic nitrate
      supplementation on clinical markers of heart ischaemia and the frequency of angina.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

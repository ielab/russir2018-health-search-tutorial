TITLE:
      Non-invasive Measuring of Cerebral Perfusion After Severe Brain Injury With Near-infrared-spectroscopy and ICG
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to show if it is possible to detect secondary ischemic events
      in patients with severe brain injury or cerebral haemorrhage with the help of non-invasive
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) by using the indocyanine green measuring of cerebral
      perfusion.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years

          -  onset of clinical symptoms of subarachnoid or intracranial haemorrhage or trauma
             suffered less than 72h

          -  indication for implanting a tissue oxygen and intracranial pressure probe

          -  A signed informed consent by the patient or legal guardian

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persistent epidural, subdural or subcutaneous hematoma in planned area of the NIRS
             optode

          -  Open injuries in the area of the planned optodes

          -  Malignant primary disease under chemotherapy

          -  pregnancy

          -  bleeding disorder

          -  In the short term unfavorable prognosis (eg, bilateral wide and light-fixed pupils)

          -  Patients with pacemakers or where no MRI compatibility is due to non- removable metal
             parts

          -  contraindications for contrast media in CT (eg, iodine allergy)

          -  Untreated hyperthyroidism

          -  End Stage Renal Disease

          -  severe psychomotor agitation

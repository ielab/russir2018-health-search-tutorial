TITLE:
      Dietary Nitrate in COPD
SUMMARY:
      The acute consumption of dietary nitrate has been shown to improve exercise capacity in
      athletes, healthy adults and subjects with peripheral vascular disease. Many COPD patients
      have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate
      consumption, in the form of beetroot juice, might increase incremental shuttle walk test
      (ISWT) distance in COPD subjects.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to improve exercise
      capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with peripheral vascular disease. Many
      COPD patients have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute
      nitrate consumption might increase incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance in COPD
      subjects compared to a matched, low-nitrate drink.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial.

      Resting blood pressure, phlebotomy and ISWT are performed. Following completion, each
      subject is randomized to consume beetroot juice or placebo. 3 hours later, the same
      assessments are repeated by the same people. After a 7d washout, the entire protocol is
      repeated with the crossover beverage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who required supplemental oxygen for exercise

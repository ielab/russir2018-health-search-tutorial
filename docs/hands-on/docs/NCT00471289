TITLE:
      PTA and Drug Eluting Stents for Infrapopliteal Lesions in Critical Limb Ischemia
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of paclitaxel-coated balloon
      expandable stainless steel coronary stent for the treatment of infrapopliteal stenoses and
      occlusions in patients with critical limb ischemia compared to percutaneous transluminal
      balloon angioplasty (PTA).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a serious condition that is becoming more and more common in
      the western world due to the growing percentage of elderly in the population and the rising
      incidence of diabetes. In about 40% of patients a stenosis or occlusion in the arteries
      below the level of the knee will be present. Restoration of blood flow is imperative to
      allow pain relief and tissue healing. Without revascularization patients with CLI are at
      risk for limb loss and potentially fatal complications such as sepsis.

      In patients treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA)significant
      restenosis is found in approximately 50% after 6 months.

      In interventional cardiology a significant reduction in restenosis rates in coronary
      arteries has been found using drug eluting stents (DES), including the paclitaxel eluting
      stent (TAXUS, Boston Scientific). DES locally deliver drugs (e.g. paclitaxel) that interfere
      with the restenosis process.

      Using DES in treating below the knee (infrapopliteal) arterial lesions in patients with CLI
      may improve patency and clinical outcome.

      Comparison:

      Treatment of below the knee arterial lesions in patients with CLI with PTA and DES compared
      to only PTA.

TITLE:
      Immediate Mobilization After Cardiac Catheterisation
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the frequency of bleeding and haematomas in
      patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention via femoral
      artery and mobilized immediately after the procedure, compared to those mobilized after two
      hours (following the standard regimen). At the same time the investigators will investigate
      whether it reduces the discomfort being mobilized immediately after the procedure.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The frequency of hematoma, bleeding or pseudoaneurysm at the access site in the groin is
      7-15% with regimens that involve 0-2 hours of bed rest, somewhat more frequent after
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than coronary angiography (CAG). There seems to be
      no reduction in the complications of the CAG or PCI by maintaining the bed rest for more
      than 2 hours after the procedure. Angio-Seal seems most effective of current closure
      devices. There is less discomfort associated with early compared with late mobilization.
      Protamine reverse heparin's effect without the side effects of that regime.

      There lacks a larger randomized study of the safety of mobilizing patients immediately after
      CAG and after PCI.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CAG or PCI performed via the femoral artery

          -  No hematoma in the groin (> 5 cm in diameter)

          -  Heparin reversed with protamine after PCI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Oozing, bleeding or hematoma

          -  Treatment with Integrilin, ReoPro, or Marevan

          -  Heparin can not be reversed

          -  The patient does not want to participate

          -  Systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg after the procedure

          -  BMI> 35 (can be modified if the groin can be assessed in an upright position)

          -  Demented, unconscious patients who do not understand the information for
             participants.

TITLE:
      Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine-Serum Free Compared to Human Diploid Cell Vaccine in a Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Regimen
SUMMARY:
      The aim of the study is to document immunogenicity and safety of VRVg in a pre-exposure
      regimen in healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is non-inferior to Imovax® Rabies in terms of proportion of
           subjects achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5
           international units (IU)/mL at D42, i.e. 14 days after the last vaccination.

        -  To describe if at least 99% of subjects achieve an RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at D42 with a
           lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of at least 97%, in the VRVg group.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical safety of each vaccine after each vaccine injection when
           administered in a pre-exposure schedule.

        -  To describe the immune response induced by each vaccine 14 days after the last
           vaccination, i.e. at D42, and 6 months after the first vaccination

        -  To describe the geometric mean titer ratio between the two vaccine groups at D42, i.e.
           14 days after the last vaccination.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Participants will receive a total of three vaccinations, one each at Day 0, Day 7, and Day
      28, respectively, and will be assessment for immune response to rabies vaccine before the
      first injection (baseline titer), at Day 42, and at Month 6.

      Safety will be assessed in all participants up to 28 days after each injection. Serious
      adverse events and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be collected up to 6
      months after the last injection.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

             using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior
             to the first vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination)

          -  Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 4 weeks preceding the first
             trial vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in
             another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical
             procedure

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or
             planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination

          -  Any previous vaccination against rabies (in pre- or post-exposure regimen) with
             either the trial vaccine or another vaccine

          -  Bite by a potentially rabid animal in the previous 6 months without post-exposure
             prophylaxis

          -  Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months

          -  Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of
             immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy,
             within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy
             (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months)

          -  Self-reported seropositivity for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a
             life-threatening reaction to a vaccine containing any of the same substances

          -  Self-reported thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination

          -  Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion,
             contraindicating intramuscular vaccination

          -  Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,
             or hospitalized involuntarily

          -  Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction

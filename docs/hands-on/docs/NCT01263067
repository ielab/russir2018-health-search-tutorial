TITLE:
      Lifespan Integration for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder From an Auto Accident
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if lifespan integration (LI) therapy reduces
      posttraumatic stress symptoms following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) trauma
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Studies estimate a substantial proportion of MVA survivors, ranging from 9.4% to 59.9%, will
      develop PTSD following an accident (Blanchard & Hickling, 2004). Based on conservative
      estimates, past research, indicates that MVA-related PTSD may affect 2.5 to 7 million
      persons in the United States (Blanchard & Hickling). Furthermore, two seminal
      epidemiological studies (Kessler et al., 1995; Norris, 1992) that focused on causes of adult
      PTSD identified MVAs as the most frequent trauma resulting in PTSD. For these reasons,
      MVA-resultant PTSD represents a significant public health problem that needs not only to be
      thoroughly understood, but addressed with successful mental health treatment options (Beck &
      Coffey, 2007; Blanchard & Hickling, 1997, 2004; Bryant et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 1999;
      Taylor et al., 2001). Although there is empirical literature on the treatment of PTSD
      following an MVA, additional efficacious and rigorously conducted studies with statistical
      underpinnings are required to determine the results that can be expected from alternative
      models of care (Beck & Coffey; Blanchard & Hickling, 1997, 2004).

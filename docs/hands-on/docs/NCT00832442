TITLE:
      Collaborative Systematic Overview of Randomised Controlled Trials of Beta-Blockers in the Treatment of Heart Failure
SUMMARY:
      Several large trials have shown that beta-blocker treatment reduces the risk of death and
      hospital admission in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Unfortunately, survey data
      suggests relatively poor utilisation of beta-blockers, despite ample evidence for good
      tolerability. Additionally there are several important unanswered questions, such as
      clinical efficacy for specific sub-populations (women, the elderly and patients with
      diabetes or other co-morbidities) and the effect of beta-blockers in combination with other
      medications. Previous meta-analyses, based on published tabular data, have been conducted
      although this approach has important biases and limitations.

      We plan to perform a carefully conducted systematic review of individual patient data from
      the major randomised trials of beta-blockers in heart failure. The goals of this
      collaborative project are to clarify the overall efficacy of beta-blockers and identify
      sub-groups that show particular benefit, thereby increasing the use of beta-blockers,
      reducing adverse clinical outcomes and the high costs associated with this condition.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Randomised control trials of beta-blocker versus control in patients with documented
             heart failure

          -  Unconfounded trials only (in which one treatment group differed from another only by
             the beta-blocker therapy of interest)

          -  Randomization process precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment (for example
             trials in which treatment allocation was alternate or based on odd or even dates
             would not be included)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Trial sample size of less than 300 patients

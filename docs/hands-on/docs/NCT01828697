TITLE:
      Comparison of Low and Intermediate Dose Low-molecular-weight Heparin to Prevent Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Pregnancy
SUMMARY:
      This is a randomized-controlled open-label trial comparing two different doses of
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in pregnant patients with a history of previous venous
      thromboembolism (VTE). Both doses are recommended doses in the 2012 guidelines of the
      American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), but it is not known which dose is more
      efficacious in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.

      Patients enter the study and will be randomized as soon as a home test confirms pregnancy.
      LMWH will be administered until 6 weeks postpartum. Follow-up will continue until 3 months
      postpartum. Patients will be recruited by their treating physician, either an obstetrician
      or internist.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 18 years or older, and;

          -  Pregnancy confirmed by urinary pregnancy test, and;

          -  Gestational age < 14 weeks, and;

          -  Previous objectively confirmed VTE, either unprovoked, in the presence of use of oral
             contraceptives or estrogen/progestagen use, or related to pregnancy or the postpartum
             period, or minor risk factors (e.g. long distance travel, minor trauma).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous VTE related to a major provoking risk factor (e.g. surgery, major trauma or
             plaster cast immobilisation in the 3 months prior to VTE) as the sole risk factor,
             or;

          -  Indication for treatment with therapeutic dose anticoagulant therapy (e.g. treatment
             of acute VTE; permanent use of therapeutic anticoagulants outside of pregnancy), or;

          -  Inability to provide informed consent, or;

          -  Any contraindication listed in the local labelling of LMWH.

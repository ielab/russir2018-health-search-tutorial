TITLE:
      Usefulness of Chest Wall Tenderness as Bedside Test to Exclude Acute Coronary Syndrome in Different Demographic Groups
SUMMARY:
      To determine the significance of a simple bedside clinical test (chest wall tenderness) to
      exclude myocardial ischemia in different demographic groups.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      When a patient is presenting with acute chest pain at the ER of the University Hospital of
      Zurich, the study physician in charge, who is acting simultaneously as one of four attending
      clinical physicians, is performing the physical examination according to routine clinical
      practice. The physical examination includes the testing of chest wall tenderness: Palpation
      of chest wall tenderness in lying 30Â° elevation of chest position. Flat index with
      standardized pressure where spontaneous maximum pain is reported (reproducible vs. not
      reproducible pain vs. no pain). Negative control (right side of chest mid-clavicle
      intercostal 6/7), reproducible vs. not reproducible pain vs. no pain. The same physician,
      who is blinded for the final diagnosis at the time of the physical examination, is also
      recording the patient history including the study interview using the standardized study
      questionnaire.

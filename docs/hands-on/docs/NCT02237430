TITLE:
      Randomized Comparison of MynxGrip Vascular Closure Device and Manual Compression for Closure After Femoral Access Angiography. The Closure Devices Used in Every Day Practice Study, CLOSE-UP III Trial
SUMMARY:
      Is the MynxGrip (test device) non-inferior to manuel compression (standard comparator) in
      the incidence of adverse access site related events in-hospital, at 30 days and at 6 months.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Prospective, randomized (1:1), controlled, non-blinded, single center study in 2000 patients
      comparing the MynxGrip (test device) and manuel compression (standard comparator). Safety
      and efficacy endpoints will be reported for in-hospital, 30 days and 6 months.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  >18 year

          -  Should be able to provide valid informed signed consent

          -  CAG, possibly including intracoronary measurement (FFR) or intracoronary imaging
             (IVUS, optical coherence tomography (OCT), NIRS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure and/or implantation of stents

          -  ST-Elevations Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)

          -  Multiple punctures

          -  Active infection

          -  Groin haematoma before the closure procedure

          -  Known pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous (AV) fistula in the ipsilateral groin

          -  Cardiogenic shock

          -  Prior peripheral arterial surgery in abdomen or lower extremities

          -  Sheat size >7 F

          -  Life expectancy less than one year

          -  Possible pregnancy or positive pregnancy test or breastfeeding women

          -  Simultaneous or planned subsequent femoral vein access

          -  Allergy to any of the components in the closure material left in the groin

          -  Puncture or closure with closure device at same site < 30 days

          -  Puncture or closure with manuel compression at same site < 5 days

          -  Patients with peripheral artery disease can be included at operators discretion
             except if heavy calcification is present at the access site, which at the operators
             discretion precludes insertion of the closure device

TITLE:
      Effects of Antihypertensive Drugs in Patients With Hypertension and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
SUMMARY:
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of different types of
      antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin II receptor blockers and long-acting calcium channel
      blockers) in patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea who are not controlled
      well with their hypertension after continuous positive airway pressure therapy.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension have a significant interrelationship, and
      both disorders are well known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Treating them
      appropriately may improve the prognosis of the patients. Presently, continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the first-line therapy for OSA, and angiotensin II
      receptor blockers and long-acting calcium channel blockers for hypertension in Japan.
      Therefore, in the present study, we wanted to compare the effects of these different types
      of antihypertensive drugs on the control of blood pressure in patients with OSA whose
      hypertension is not controlled well after CPAP therapy.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Apnea and hypopnea index of more than 20 /hr, and treated with CPAP

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of more than 130 mmHg
             or diastolic blood pressure of more than 80 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cerebrovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or heart failure
             within 6 months

          -  Uncontrolled arrhythmia

          -  Severe hepatic or renal disorders

          -  Having poor prognosis disorders such as malignant disorders

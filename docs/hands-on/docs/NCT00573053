TITLE:
      Effects of Targeting Lower Arterial Oxygen Saturations on the Development of Control of Breathing in Very Preterm Infants
SUMMARY:
      To determine whether targeting lower arterial oxygen saturations from the day of birth
      alters the early (first 3 months) postnatal development of the control of ventilation and
      the hypercapnic and hyperoxic responses in very preterm infants.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      To measure the effects of baseline oxygenation in extremely low birth weight preterm infants
      on:

      i) The early (first 5 breaths) and late or steady state (3-5 minutes) ventilatory response
      to CO2 ii) The immediate (< 1 minute) ventilatory response to hyperoxia iii) The PCO2 apneic
      threshold iv) The breathing pattern during quiet and REM sleep v) The morphology of periodic
      breathing cycles vi) The incidence and morphology of sighs

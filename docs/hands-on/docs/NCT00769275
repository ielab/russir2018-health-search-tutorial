TITLE:
      Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics
SUMMARY:
      Asymptomatic subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus were randomized to either screening with
      Tc-99m sestamibi adenosine SPECT imaging or no screening. All patients will be followed for
      5 years for the occurrence of cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction.

      The aims are:

        1. To prospectively assess the prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic
           subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

        2. To identify on the basis of clinical and/or biochemical variables in a high-risk cohort
           in which screening for coronary artery disease is appropriate.

        3. To assess progression of (silent) myocardial ischemia after 3 years.

        4. To assess the occurence of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction during 5
           years follow-up in screened and not screened subjects.

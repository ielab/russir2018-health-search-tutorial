TITLE:
      Effects of High Voltage Electrical Stimulation, Shortwave Diathermy and Kinesiotherapy on Arterial Blood Flow in the Lower Limbs of Diabetic Women
SUMMARY:
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a pathological condition limiting, resulting from a
      narrowing or occlusion of the artery diameter due to aneurysms, inflammation,
      atherosclerosis and thromboembolic events. One of the main risk factors for the development
      of DAP is diabetes mellitus due to its relation to the process of atherogenesis. Thus, the
      objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of three treatment modalities for PAD on
      the blood flow velocity. It is a crossover study. Fifteen women with diabetes receive three
      types of treatment, the order defined according draw: high voltage electrical stimulation,
      shortwave diathermy and kinesiotherapy. The blood flow of the lower limb will be assessed by
      Doppler ultrasound. The hypothesis of this study is that physical therapy resources increase
      the circulation of the lower limb.

TITLE:
      Postpartum Anemia and Postpartum Depression
SUMMARY:
      Postpartum anemia (PPA) and Postpartum depression (PPD) are common afflictions affecting
      women after childbirth. Both disorders have a significant impact on women's health and
      functional status. Despite common symptoms and characteristics, a link between these
      entities has not been adequately studied. The objective of this study is to determine
      whether postpartum anemia is an independent risk factor for the development of postpartum
      depression. This prospective cohort study will include all women delivered by elective term
      cesarean delivery. Hemoglobin and iron levels will be measured, standardized questionnaires
      for assessment of PPD, functional status and lactation will be administered before discharge
      and at 3 & 6 weeks post partum. Hemoglobin levels at each time point will be analyzed for
      correlation with depressive symptoms, functional status and lactation success.

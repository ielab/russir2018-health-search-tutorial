TITLE:
      Safety and Performance Study of Large Hole Vascular Closure Device
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this Clinical Investigation is to validate that the clinical use of the
      VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE™ is safe for the operator, patient and third parties, and to confirm
      its performance to percutaneously close femoral arterial puncture sites in the range of
      18-24 F, post endovascular procedures.

      This is a non-inferiority study based on safety. Safety will be assessed by incidence and
      severity of major complication rates directly related to the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE™ up to
      3 months from implantation is no worse than those associated with cut-down and sutured
      close.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      This study will be a prospective, multi-centred, non-randomized study to investigate the
      safety and performance of the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE™. The study shall not be blinded prior
      to, during or post the procedure. All patients undergoing a procedure requiring an
      arteriotomy in the range of 18 to 24 F, via the common femoral artery will be screened
      against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets the requirements of the
      clinical investigation, they shall be invited to participate, provide informed consent and
      shall subsequently be assigned a subject number.

      All subjects shall have an immediately post procedure, 24 hour, 1, 3 and 12 month follow-up
      assessment. Safety data from the follow-ups will be assessed by the Data Safety Monitoring
      Committee.

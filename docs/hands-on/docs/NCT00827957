TITLE:
      Comparing Therapeutic Hypothermia Using External and Internal Cooling for Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients
SUMMARY:
      Controlled therapeutic hypothermia is a method of preserving neurological function
      post-resuscitation.It has been associated with improved functional recovery and reduced
      histological deficits in animal models of cardiac arrest.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Three randomized clinical studies have been reported showing improved neurological outcome
      and reduced mortality in post-resuscitation patients treated with hypothermia compared to
      controls. Of the various methods of inducing hypothermia, internal cooling using an
      endovascular catheter and external cooling using gel pads with a water based circulating
      system have shown the most promise. There have not been any studies looking at outcomes
      between the two methods of cooling.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest, for more
             than 30 min

          2. Patients aged between 18 to 80 years.

          3. Patients who are hemodynamically stable, with a systolic BP > 90 mmHg with or without
             inotropic support.

          4. Patients comatose or unresponsive post-resuscitation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypotension despite fluid and/or vasopressor support

          2. Positive pregnancy test in women below 50 years

          3. Premorbid status bedbound and uncommunicative

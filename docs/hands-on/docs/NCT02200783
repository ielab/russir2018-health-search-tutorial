TITLE:
      Randomized Comparison of Radiological Exposure With TRIPTable® in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes
SUMMARY:
      Excessive radiation received by the operator has been described as a possible drawback of
      the radial catheterization technique when compared with the femoral access.

      The study hypothesis is that the use of radial access device dedicated radioprotective
      TRIPTable ® (Transradial Intervention Table Protection) is not inferior to standard femoral
      technique and superior to standard radial technique as radioprotection strategy to the
      operator in patients with acute coronary syndromes acute and submitted to cardiac
      catheterization.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      This study is prospective, 1:1:1 randomized, unicentric, comparative between femoral and
      radial radial technique with and without dedicated TRIPTable ® device.

      The TripTable device is a polycarbonate support table anatomically-designed to facilitate
      the radial technique, facilitating the puncturing, positioning, support to work material and
      providing further radioprotection from a lead layer without obstruction in viewing the
      fluoroscopic images.

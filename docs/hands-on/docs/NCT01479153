TITLE:
      Venous Site for Central Catheterization
SUMMARY:
      Central venous catheters are needed in the critical care setting to administer drugs. Three
      sites are available to gain vascular access: subclavian, internal jugular and femoral. Each
      site has complications, but there is no randomized controlled study which compared the 3
      sites.

      The investigators hypothesis is that subclavian catheterization reduces the risk of major
      complications compared to internal jugular or femoral.

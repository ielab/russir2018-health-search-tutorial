TITLE:
      Transpulmonary Thermodilution and Transesophageal Echocardiography in Early Septic Shock
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to assess the concordance of therapeutic changes proposed after
      an early hemodynamic evaluation (hemodynamic profile) in septic shock patients using jointly
      the transpulmonary thermodilution technique and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Each patient will be assessed by both the transpulmonary thermodilution technique and TEE
      (H0). The two assessments will be performed in random order (central randomization
      stratified by participating center), but within 30 minutes (no change of ongoing treatment
      during the assessment period). Two investigators not involved in patient care and blinded to
      the results of the alternative technique will performed independently the hemodynamic
      assessment using one of the two modalities for hemodynamic assessment tested in the study.
      They will interpret the results at bedside and propose a therapeutic change to the attending
      physician, according to the hemodynamic profile. The latter will finally: precisely identify
      the clinical problem to be solved (e.g., therapeutic target of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign
      not reached, tissue hypoperfusion), choose a therapy adapted while taking into account the
      clinical scenario and the results of both the transpulmonary thermodilution and TEE,
      evaluate the efficacy of this treatment (problem solved or not) and its tolerance (potential
      side-effect attributable to the treatment). In addition, the presence or resolution of signs
      of tissue hypoperfusion will systematically be assessed at H6, H12 and H24. Primary and
      secondary outcomes will be assessed by an independent committee of experts.

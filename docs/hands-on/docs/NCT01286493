TITLE:
      Immune Response After Booster Vaccination in HIV - Infected Patients Who Received Rabies Primary Vaccination
SUMMARY:
      Booster rabies vaccination in HIV - infected patients who have ever received rabies primary
      vaccination could improve their immune response to this kind of vaccine.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The investigators have learned from the previous studies that some HIV-infected patients
      especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had poor antibody response to rabies
      vaccination. Because of the role of the memory B cell, the investigators hypothesized that
      primary rabies immunization in HIV-infected patients could rise rapid anamnestic antibody
      response to ones after booster vaccination in case of re-exposure of rabies occur despite of
      their immunocompromised state.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV infected patients 18-60 years of age

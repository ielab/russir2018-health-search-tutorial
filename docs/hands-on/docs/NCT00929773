TITLE:
      Low Level Laser Therapy to Reduce Chronic Pain
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether low level laser light directed at the
      neck and shoulders could be effective in the temporary reduction of chronic pain in the neck
      and shoulder region.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Chronic neck and shoulder pain arising from osteoarthritis, chronic muscle spasms or
      thoracic or cervical spine sprain strain can be seriously debilitating. Currently available
      treatment options such as pain relief medication, ice pack, massage, physical therapy and
      chiropractic are typically of limited effectiveness. More permanent options such as surgery
      are invasive with long recovery periods and side-effects and complications of their own. Low
      level laser light therapy, with its proven anti-inflammatory ability, offers a simple
      non-invasive option for the reduction of chronic neck and shoulder pain.

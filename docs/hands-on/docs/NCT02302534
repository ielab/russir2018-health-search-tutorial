TITLE:
      Pilot Study of Functional and Morphometric Brain Abnormalities Related to Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (MOR-FO-SIA)
SUMMARY:
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex deformity with different curves. These
      different curves may be distinguished by different physiopathologic mechanisms.

      Without fully convincing model of the emergence and development of AIS, their multifactorial
      nature seems evident. Several pathophysiological theories involving the central nervous
      system have been proposed: the AIS would be associated with disturbances of proprioceptive
      or sensory perception, and/or with integration of this information. This would result in an
      abnormal body image, responsible for sensorimotor asymmetry that may promote or cause the
      deformation.

      The Main aim of this study is to find cortical and subcortical morphometric differences in
      the most common population of AIS (right thoracic AIS) compared to healthy adolescent
      control girls.

      Secondary Objectives are to study the cerebral white matter of the same groups (fractional
      anisotropy in the main white matter tracts), and activation of sensorimotor neural networks
      (fMRI activation and functional brain connectivity).

      Abnormalities of the studied parameters may be used as biomarkers for AIS diagnosis and
      classification.

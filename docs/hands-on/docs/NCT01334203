TITLE:
      A Study on the Effects of Ranolazine on Exercise Duration in Subjects With Chronic Stable Angina and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
SUMMARY:
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of ranolazine compared to placebo on duration of
      exercise assessed by exercise tolerance testing (ETT) at anticipated peak ranolazine plasma
      concentration after 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with chronic stable angina and
      coronary artery disease (CAD) who have a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of ranolazine compared to placebo on duration of
      exercise assessed by exercise tolerance testing (ETT) at anticipated peak ranolazine plasma
      concentration after 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with chronic stable angina and
      coronary artery disease (CAD) who have a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This is
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in subjects with
      chronic stable angina and CAD receiving a stable dose of a single concomitant antianginal
      medication who also have a history of T2DM; allowed antianginals will be a beta-blocker
      (atenolol or metoprolol) or a calcium-channel blocker.

                  verapamil 180 to 360 mg daily)

          -  Willingness to discontinue other antianginals and be treated with one of the allowed
             antianginal therapies

          -  Documented history of type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective
             contraception methods from Screening throughout the duration of study treatment and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to exercise or having exercise limitation due to other co-morbidities that
             may interfere with ability to perform required ETT (e.g., morbid obesity, significant
             chronic lung disease, prior hospitalization for acute exacerbation of chronic lung
             disease or home oxygen use, chronic oral steroid therapy that can limit exercise
             capacity, osteoarthritis, peripheral artery disease, etc.)

          -  Any absolute contraindication to ETT

          -  Presence of electrocardiographic or other abnormalities that interfere with ECG
             interpretation or may cause a false positive stress test (e.g., ≥ 1 mm horizontal or
             down-sloping ST segment depression at rest in any standard ECG lead,
             Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, left bundle branch
             block, left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormality, ventricular
             pacemaker, etc.)

          -  Decompensated heart failure

          -  Clinically significant valvular heart disease or congenital cardiac defects

          -  Acute coronary syndrome in the prior 2 months or coronary revascularization within
             the prior 6 months or planned coronary revascularization during the study period

             blood pressure > 110 mm Hg)

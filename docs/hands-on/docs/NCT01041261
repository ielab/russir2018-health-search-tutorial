TITLE:
      Effects of a Novel Dietary Intervention on Body Composition After Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Surgery
SUMMARY:
      We propose to compare the standard of care with the use of a novel medical food in 6
      bariatric surgery patients by measuring outcomes of body composition, quality of life, hair
      loss, muscle strength, resting energy expenditure, and biochemical parameters.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      STUDY SUMMARY The purpose of this pilot study is to compare a medical food intervention with
      the dietary standard of care at Boston Medical Center, in obese women subjects undergoing
      Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery. Commercially available nutritional supplements will also
      be provided as part of the study's protocol.

      Subjects will be selected from surgical candidates of the Nutrition and Weight Management
      Center who meet the study criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 2
      groups (treatment and control). Subjects will be seen at the study site 2 weeks before
      surgery and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery (for a total of 5
      visits). Data recorded during the study visits will be used to assess post-operative
      progress and will include: body composition, resting energy expenditure, muscle strength,
      quality of life questionnaires, hair loss, and blood markers for insulin resistance,
      nutritional state, organ function, lipid profile and inflammation. Safety indicators and
      compliance will also be monitored.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Obese and morbidly obese women (BMI 30 - 50)

          -  25 years and older undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery

          -  Present with at least either metabolic syndrome or diabetes

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have smoked in the past 4 weeks

          -  Pregnant

          -  There is a sound medical, psychiatric and/or social reason as determined by the
             Principal Investigator (PI) that makes the subject unsuitable for the study

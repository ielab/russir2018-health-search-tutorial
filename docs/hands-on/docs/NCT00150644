TITLE:
      A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Asoprisnil(J867) in Women With Uterine Fibroids Who Are Scheduled for a Hysterectomy
SUMMARY:
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg doses of
      asoprisnil, compared to placebo, taken daily for 12 weeks, on uterine blood flow and the
      morphology of the endometrium and uterine fibroids.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of uterine fibroids.
      The objective of this study is to determine the effects of asoprisnil in uterine fibroid
      growth suppression. Full thickness biopsies obtained from surgical procedures will allow the
      assessment of asoprisnil's effects on the basalis, the myometrium, and on endometrial
      angiogenesis. Various other exploratory immunohistological and biochemical specimens will be
      collected to evaluate the mechanisms of action of asoprisnil in the endometrium, the
      myometrium, and in uterine fibroids.

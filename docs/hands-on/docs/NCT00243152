TITLE:
      Evaluation of Lamotrigine on Neuropathic Facial Pain Using fMRI
SUMMARY:
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine
      (trade name Lamictal) on neuropathic facial pain or neuralgia using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Currently there are no pharmacological agents that can control neuropathic pain akin to the
      efficacy of antibiotics for bacterial infection. All current neuropathic pain drugs have
      approximately the same efficacy of less than 30% in controlled trials, and many of these
      drugs do not have known mechanisms of action. fMRI studies may provide insight into how
      brain circuitry is altered by chronic pain, and how these drugs act on altered circuitry.
      The trigeminal system in particular offers unique advantages for studying such alterations,
      including a large central representation and high degree of somatotopy. The administration
      of lamotrigine to neuropathic pain patients in conjunction with fMRI will allow us to
      compare subjective ratings of pain with objective measures of neural activity during
      increased conditions of allodynia/hyperalgesia.

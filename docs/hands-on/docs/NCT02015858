TITLE:
      Pain During Chest Tube Withdrawal: Evaluation Using Pan Monitor
SUMMARY:
      Pain evaluation remains a clinical problem. Pain Monitor allows pain evaluation using the
      measurement of skin conductance.

      Withdrawal of chest tube can be painful and the purpose of the study was to compare
      auto-evaluation of pain (visual analogic scale) and the index measured by the Pain Monitor.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients undergoing removal of a chest tube after lung surgery,

          -  patients able to indicate the pain score.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnancy, lactation ,

          -  insulin-dependent diabetes with dysautonomia,

          -  central or peripheral neurological disease, agitation,

          -  inability to understand the protocol,

          -  inability to use the Pain Monitor: skin abnormalities at the site of measurement,
             pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, condition affecting the sympathetic nervous
             system, tremor of the extremities,

          -  contra-indication to oral morphine ,

          -  respiratory failure, severe hepatic insufficiency, intracranial hypertension,
             epilepsy associations

          -  recent administration of neostigmine or of atropine.

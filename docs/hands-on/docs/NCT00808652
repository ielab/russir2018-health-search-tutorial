TITLE:
      Prevalence and Outcome of Brachial Artery Endothelial Function in Morbidly Obese Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery
SUMMARY:
      The relation between obesity and ischemic heart disease (IHD) is under considerable debate.
      The reduction in all-cause mortality and, more specifically, the reduction in
      cardiac-related mortality seen after weight-loss surgery, may be due to regression or
      slowing developement of subclinical IHD. Function of cells lining the arteries (endothelium)
      is closely related to the state of IHD and its measurement can serve as a surrogate marker
      for the existence and severity of IHD. The investigators hypothesize that the prevalence of
      undiagnosed IHD in the morbidly obese population is high and that following surgery for
      weight reduction there is a halt in the progression, or even a regression in its severity.

      The study includes measurement of endothelial function before and after weight-reducing
      surgery.

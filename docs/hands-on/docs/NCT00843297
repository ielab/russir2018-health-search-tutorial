TITLE:
      COOL-Trial: Outcome With Invasive and Non-invasive Cooling After Cardiac Arrest
SUMMARY:
      Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains one of the major leading causes of death. Cognitive
      deficits are common in survivors of SCA. Postresuscitative mild induced hypothermia (MIH)
      lowers mortality and reduces neurologic damage after cardiac arrest. The investigators
      evaluated the efficacy and side effects of therapeutic hypothermia in an unselected group of
      patients after SCA.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Consecutive patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after resuscitation
      due to out-of-hospital SCA, admitted to our intensive care unit, underwent MIH. Hypothermia
      was induced by infusion of cold saline and whole-body-cooling methods (electronic
      randomization: invasive Coolgard or non-invasive ArcticSun). The core body temperature was
      operated at 32 to 34 Â°C over a period of 24 hours followed by active rewarming. Neurological
      status was evaluated at hospital discharge and 6 months after discharge using the Pittsburgh
      Cerebral Performance Category (CPC). Blood samples of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were
      collected during 72 hours.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  GCS 3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-cardiac SCA

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Unstable Circulation instead of High-dose Inotropics

          -  Life-expectancy reducing concomitant illness

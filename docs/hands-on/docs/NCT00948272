TITLE:
      Study of Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine Serum Free Compared With Reference Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine in Healthy Adults
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to generate data in human on immunogenicity and safety of
      Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine (VRVg) in support of the vaccine registration.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is at least as immunogenic as the reference vaccine, Verorab,
           in terms of seroconversion rate at Day 42 of the primary vaccination series.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical safety of VRVg after each vaccination when administered in a
           pre-exposure vaccination schedule with a booster at 12 months after the first
           vaccination in all subjects.

        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg 21 days after two vaccinations in a
           subset of randomized subjects and 14 days after the last vaccination of the primary
           vaccination series.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      All subjects will receive three vaccinations for primary series and a booster vaccination at
      12 months after the first vaccination.

          -  Entitlement to national social security

        Exclusion Criteria :

             test

          -  Breast-feeding woman

          -  Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical
             device, or a medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination

          -  Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period

          -  Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive therapy
             such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months,
             or long-term systemic corticosteroids therapy

          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components or history of a
             life-threatening reaction to the trial vaccine or to a vaccine containing any of the
             same substances

          -  Chronic illness, at a stage that could interfere with trial conduct or completion, in
             the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction that may interfere with the subject's ability
             to comply with trial procedures

          -  Receipt of blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months, that might interfere
             with the assessment of immune response

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination

          -  Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen, or
             Hepatitis C seropositivity

          -  Previous vaccination against rabies with any vaccine (in pre- or post-exposure
             regimen)

          -  Thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder or anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding
             inclusion contraindicating intramuscular (IM) vaccination

          -  Subject at high risk for rabies exposure during the trial period

          -  Subjects deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency
             setting, or hospitalized without his/her consent

          -  Febrile illness (temperature ≥38.0°C) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection
             on the day of vaccination, according to Investigator judgment.

          -  Study site employee who is involved in the protocol and may have direct access to
             trial related data.

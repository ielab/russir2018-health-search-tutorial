TITLE:
      Inhaled Corticosteroids for the Treatment of Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn
SUMMARY:
      Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN) is a common respiratory disorder affecting late
      preterm and term babies caused by lung edema resulting from delayed absorption of fetal
      alveolar lung fluid.

      The investigators hypothesize that ENAC expression will be up-regulated as a result of
      administration of corticosteroids. This effect will lead to enhanced absorption of fetal
      lung fluid finally treating TTN. The aim of our study will be to evaluate whether inhaled
      corticosteroids reduce respiratory distress and morbidity in late preterm and term neonates
      presenting with TTN.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The primary outcome measure will be the assessment of respiratory distress reflected by TTN
      clinical score in neonates presenting with TTN and treated with inhaled corticosteroids
      compared to placebo.

TITLE:
      Cetuximab Plus Radiotherapy Versus Cisplatin Plus Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
SUMMARY:
      BACKGROUND:

      Concomitant radiotherapy and cisplatin (CDDP) based chemotherapy is the standard treatment
      for LA-NHSCC. This combined modality treatment is linked with considerable acute local and
      systemic toxicity.EGFR is overexpressed in 90-100% of the HNSCC cases and is considered an
      unfavourable prognostic marker. EGFR costitutive activation is linked with HNSCC
      pathogenesis.

      Cetuximab is a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody blocking the activation of the receptor and
      signal transduction. Cetuximab combined with radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy only
      in the treatment of LA-HNSCC and is characterized by an acceptable toxicity profile.

      RATIONALE:

      A direct comparison between concomitant chemoradiotherapy with Cisplatin and the concomitant
      treatment with radiotherapy associated to cetuximab does not exist.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Arm A: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with chemotherapy with Cisplatin
      (40 mg/mq/week) Arm B: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with therapy
      with the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab (400 mg/m2 ["loading dose"] and subsequently 250 mg
      /m2/week)
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluation and comparison of the compliance of the two treatments;

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluation and comparison of the grade and incidence of acute toxicity; Evaluation and
      comparison of local control; Evaluation and comparison of event free survival (both local
      control and distant metastases); Evaluation and comparison of cause specific and overall
      survival.

      overweight women aged 25 through 44. Participants will complete brief questionnaires about
      their health, eating and exercise habits, and use of weight control strategies. They will
      then be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions. All 3 treatments receive

      healthy diet, and ways to increase activity levels. The 3 treatment differ in how this
      information is delivered. At 12, 24 and 36 months after enrolling in the study, participants

      measured.

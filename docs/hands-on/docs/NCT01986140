TITLE:
      Scalp Cooling to Prevent Chemo-induced Hair Loss
SUMMARY:
      Determine that the Orbis Paxman Hair Loss Prevention System is safe and effective in
      reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia in woman with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or
      adjuvant chemotherapy.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Cooling the scalp during chemotherapy may help reduce the chances of losing hair during

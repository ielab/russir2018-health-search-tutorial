TITLE:
      Resistance Exercise Effects on Fear Avoidance and Physical Function in Obese Older Adults With Low Back Pain
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a 4 month resistance exercise program reduces
      the severity of low back pain, pain-related fear avoidance and improves mobility compared to
      standard care.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic low back pain for >6 months

          -  >3 pain episodes per week

          -  waist circumferences ≥102 cm for men

          -  waist circumferences ≥ 88 cm for women

          -  willing and able to participate in regular exercise for 14 weeks

          -  using pain medications to control low back pain

          -  free of abnormal cardiovascular responses during a screening graded maximal walk test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  unable to walk

          -  participating in regular resistance exercise training (>3X week) in the past 6 months

          -  pain symptoms are too severe and prevent strength testing or walking

          -  acute back injury

          -  spinal stenosis that precludes walking one block due to neurogenic claudication

          -  back surgery within the past 2 years

          -  current use of weight loss interventions (drugs; exercise interventions)

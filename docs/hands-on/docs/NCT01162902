TITLE:
      Comparison of Vascular Remodeling Between Different Antianginal Medication Evaluated by Noninvasive ECG-gated Fundus Photographic Evaluation
SUMMARY:
      Treatments for stable angina includes drug therapy such as calcium-channel blocker, beta
      blocker, and ACEI/ARB. To obtain good prognosis in patients with coronary artery
      disease,preventing or correcting the progression of atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia is more
      important than relieving angina symptom. Dysfunction of microvessel is one of the most
      important factor in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, we developed the new
      non-invasive method of evaluating the microvessel in fundus. With this methods, we will
      compare the effect of each drug (beta blocker, CCB, ARB).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable angina patients whose coronary lesions is confirmed by angiography or receives
             PCI

          -  Unstable Angina/NSTEMI patients who completed PCI for main lesions

          -  Either systolic > 130mmHg or diastolic > 80mmHg, or patients with anti-hypertensive
             drugs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  STEMI patients within one month

          -  Variant Angina

          -  Liver function abnormality or renal failure

          -  History of Hypersensitivity to testing drugs

          -  Severe heart failure(NYHA class>3) or uncorrectable hematologic disease

          -  Woman possible to be pregnant

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes

TITLE:
      A Comparison Between Intravenous Iron Sucrose to Its Combination With Oral Iron Supplements for the Treatment of Postpartum Anemia
SUMMARY:
      This study is aimed to compare the efficacy of two mode of iron administration to treat post
      partum anemia - a single dose of intravenous iron sucrose versus a single dose of iron
      sucrose and 6 weeks of treatment with oral iron supplement.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Anemia is common following delivery. It is associated with disturbing symptoms such as
      fatigue, cognitive impairment and syncope in severe cases. International guidelines
      recommend to use intravenous iron sucrose to treat intermediate and severe anemia until the
      target hemoglobin is achieved. However, patient's compliance after delivery is low, making
      the administration of several doses difficult. In those cases oral iron supplements might be
      used. In the present study the investigators will compare the efficacy of two iron
      administration protocols to treat post partum anemia - a single dose of intravenous iron
      sucrose versus a single dose of iron sucrose and 6 weeks of treatment with oral iron
      supplement.

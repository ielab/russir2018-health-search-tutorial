TITLE:
      IOP Fluctuations in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma Patients Before and After Deep Sclerectomy With Collagen Implant
SUMMARY:
      Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is associated with inadequate drainage of the aqueous
      humor via the trabecular meshwork towards the systemic circulation. This may lead to an
      increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose of glaucoma management is to
      lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic neuropathy and subsequent visual
      loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering drug therapy. However, if IOP
      remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP,
      surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy with a collagen implant (DSCI) is a
      non-penetrating surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the
      enhancement of the aqueous outflow. This forms the rationale to conduct this prospective,
      open label study to assess the 24-hour IOP fluctuation profile recorded with Triggerfish® in
      patients with POAG before and after DSCI.

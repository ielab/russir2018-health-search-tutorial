TITLE:
      The Effect of Anticholinergics on Cognitive Function in the Elderly
SUMMARY:
      Anticholinergic medication is used to treat overactive bladder (OAB). A known side effect of
      this medication is cognitive dysfunction. OAB is more prevalent in the elderly population -
      a group that also has a higher baseline risk of cognitive dysfunction. Our objective is to
      evaluate the effect of an anticholinergic medication on cognitive function in elderly women.
      Subjects will be randomized to:1) trospium chloride or 2) placebo. There are three aims: 1)
      To evaluate changes in cognitive function in elderly women taking trospium versus placebo,
      using validated cognitive assessment tests. 2) To develop a useful battery of cognitive
      screening tests for monitoring the cognitive safety of OAB management. 3) To understand how
      the timing of cognitive changes relates to the timing of improvement in OAB symptoms. The
      investigators will recruit 60 women aged â‰¥ 50 with the diagnosis of OAB. Cognitive
      assessments will be performed at baseline and Week 1 and 4 after drug initiation using
      paper-based validated questionnaires. OAB improvement will be assessed with validated
      questionnaires.

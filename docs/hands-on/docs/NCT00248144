TITLE:
      A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Single Day or Single Dose Famciclovir for the Treatment of Recurrent Herpes Labialis
SUMMARY:
      The study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of patient-initiated therapy with
      famciclovir 1500 mg o.d. or 750 mg b.i.d. for one day treatment in adult men and women with
      recurrent herpes labialis
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 years or older

          -  A history typical for recurrent herpes labialis. The subject must have experienced
             three or more episodes of cold sores in the last 12 months, and have a history of
             prodromal symptoms, as defined by the patient, preceding at least 50% of these cold
             sores, and must also have a history of vesicular lesions in at least 50% of the
             recurrent episodes of cold sores.

          -  General good health, without other serious medical conditions and specifically with
             normal renal and hepatic function, as determined by the patient's account of his/her
             medical history

          -  Women of child bearing potential had to use an accepted method of birth control
             (surgical sterilization; intra-uterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives;
             hormone delivery systems such as NorplantÂ® or Depo-Provera injections; a diaphragm in
             combination with contraceptive cream, jelly, or foam; or a condom in combination with
             contraceptive cream, jelly or foam). Patients unable or unwilling to use one of the
             methods of birth control listed above for the duration of the study could not enter
             the study.

          -  For women of child-bearing potential, a negative pregnancy test (urine) at screening
             was required

          -  Signature on the informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous herpes vaccination

          -  Patients using topical immunosuppressive agents (including steroids, tacrolimus and
             pimecrolimus) on or near the face or systemic immunosuppressive agents (including
             steroids, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) within 30 days of screening

          -  Patients known to be immunosuppressed due to underlying disease (e.g. HIV infection)
             or concomitant treatment (e.g. cancer chemotherapy)

          -  Recent history of alcohol or drug abuse, which in the opinion of the investigator,
             could interfere with that study patient's compliance with study requirements

          -  Significant skin disease such as atopic dermatitis or eczema that would interfere
             with the assessment of lesions

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to formulations containing acyclovir, penciclovir,
             famciclovir, and/or other nucleoside analogues

          -  Women who were lactating or breast feeding

          -  Had already been randomized once into the study

          -  Patients who had received an investigational drug in the past four weeks

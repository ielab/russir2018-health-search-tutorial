TITLE:
      Pre-discharge vs. Early Post-discharge Stress Testing and GRACE Score for Safe Discharge of ACS-patients With a Negative Hs-troponin T Result
SUMMARY:
      New high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays allow earlier detection of acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI). Furthermore, elevated values were associated with an increased
      risk of recurrent AMI or death. Therefore, guidelines recommend an early invasive strategy
      in patients with elevated admission values and kinetic changes. Other criteria for an early
      invasive strategy include a GRACE risk score >140 points or other cardiovascular risk
      factors. Hs-cTn assays allow discrimination of patients at very low and high risk. Studies
      confirmed safety of early discharge protocols in patients with unstable angina (UAP). The
      aim of this study is to 1) confirm the safety of early discharge without invasive strategy
      in patients with UAP and to 2) review the optimal timing of stress-testing. Therefore,
      patients are being randomized into 2 groups with pre-discharge and early post-discharge
      stress-testing. Endpoints are major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 and 90 days.

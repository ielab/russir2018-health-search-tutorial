SUMMARY:
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of Post-Operative Delirium (POD),
      diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), in elderly patients undergoing hip
      fracture surgery under general anaesthesia with xenon or sevoflurane, for a period of four
      days post-surgery.

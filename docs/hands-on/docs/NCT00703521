TITLE:
      Rabies Immunization Concomitant With JEV in Children
SUMMARY:
      Background. The World Health Organization recommends pre-exposure vaccination (PreP) to
      protect children living in canine rabies endemic countries. Including PreP in national
      childhood immunization programs (EPI) is a viable option.

      Methods. In an open-label phase II clinical trial, 200 healthy toddlers were randomized to
      receive Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV) in a 3-dose Full-IM (1mL), Half-IM
      (0.5mL), 3-ID (0.1mL), or a 2-dose 2-ID (0.1mL) regimen, all in combination with two doses
      of Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), or JEV alone. One booster dose of PCECV (IM or ID) and JEV,
      or JEV alone was administered concomitantly one year after primary vaccination. Safety was
      evaluated after each injection. Blood was drawn on days 0 and 49, one year later prior to
      booster and on days 7 and 28 post-booster, and at two and three years post primary
      vaccination. All sera were analyzed for rabies and JE virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA,
      JEVNA).

TITLE:
      HR-lowering Efficacy and Respiratory Safety of Ivabradine in Patients With Obstructive Airway Disease
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to investigate heart rate lowering efficacy and respiratory
      safety of ivabradine in patients with asthma and COPD.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      In this double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 20 asthmatics and 20 COPD
      patients received ivabradine 7,5 mg b.i.d. and placebo for 5 days in crossover manner. HR in
      ECG holter monitoring, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), symptoms, rescue medication
      consumption and AEs were evaluated in both periods of treatment.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  documented diagnosis of asthma or COPD in accordance with guidelines

          -  stable condition, defined as a disease without exacerbation for at least 1 month
             prior to study enrolment

          -  mean HR in holter ECG recording of â‰¥ 60 bpm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  disease exacerbation in previous month

          -  inability to understand instructions on study procedures

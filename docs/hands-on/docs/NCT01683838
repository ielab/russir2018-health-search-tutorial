TITLE:
      Safety and Efficacy of Oral Fampridine-Sustained Release (SR) for the Treatment of Spasticity Resulting From Spinal Cord Injury
SUMMARY:
      Normally, nerve fibers carry electrical impulses through the spinal cord, providing
      communication between the brain and the arms and legs. In people with spinal cord injury,
      some fibers may be destroyed at the site of injury, while others remain connected but do not
      work correctly to carry electrical impulses. As a result, subjects with an incomplete spinal
      cord injury may have spasticity which is muscle spasms or muscle stiffness that makes
      movement difficult. Fampridine-SR is an experimental drug that increases the ability of the
      nerve to conduct electrical impulses. This study will examine the effects of Fampridine-SR
      on moderate to severe lower-limb spasticity, as well as the effects on bodily functions such
      as bladder control, bowel function and sexual function. The study will also examine the
      possible risks of taking Fampridine-SR.

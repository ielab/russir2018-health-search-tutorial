TITLE:
      Rosiglitazone Versus Placebo in Chronic Stable Angina
SUMMARY:
      We wish to see if the drug rosiglitazone, currently used in the treatment of type 2
      diabetes, could be used as a new treatment for angina when compared with placebo in
      overweight subjects who do not have overt diabetes. The drug will be given for 3 months and
      the subjects will be have their angina tested, by way of exercise testing, angina quality of
      life questionnaire and 24-hour ECG monitoring before and after using the drug.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Chronic stable angina is a common manifestation of ischaemic heart disease. Current
      mechanical therapies (percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass
      grafting) and pharmacological therapies (nitrates, calcium channel blockers, betablockers
      and potassium channel activators) main actions are to treat the end product of ischaemic
      heart disease on chronic stable angina, i.e. the flow limiting stenosis. We postulate that
      by treating insulin resistance, an upstream factor in the pathogenesis of ischaemic heart
      disease, we will improve angina by in turn improving endothelial function. We will attempt
      to demonstrate this by way of full bruce protocol exercise tolerance test, Seattle Angina
      Questionnaire and 24 hour ST segment analysis before and after treatment with the insulin
      sensitiser rosiglitazone for three months.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic stable angina - to see if this improves

          -  Previous positive exercise tolerance test - to ensure that repeating it yields a
             result

          -  Disease not suitable for coronary intervention (Coronary artery bypass grafting or
             angioplasty) - so that best routine care is not withheld

          -  Do not have overt diabetes - work on this is being undertaken elsewhere

          -  Body mass index (BMI) greater than 25

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes mellitus - see above

          -  Liver failure (ALT>70U/l, AST>80U/l)

          -  Renal failure (creatinine > 130mmol/l)

          -  Cardiac failure - rosiglitazone is contraindicated in those with NYHA 3 and 4 cardiac
             failure

          -  Physical disability - if it precludes treadmill testing

          -  Women of child bearing capacity

          -  Breast feeding mothers

TITLE:
      Impact of a Multifaceted Program to Prevent Postoperative Delirium in the Elderly
SUMMARY:
      Postoperative delirium is common in the elderly and is associated with a significant
      increase in mortality, complications, length of hospital stay and admission in long care
      facility. Several interventions have proved their effectiveness to prevent it but their
      combination within a multifaceted intervention needs to be assessed using rigorous
      methodology based on randomized study design. CONFUCIUS trial aims to measure the impact of
      a multifaceted program on the prevention of postoperative delirium in elderly.

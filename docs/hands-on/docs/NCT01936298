TITLE:
      Robot-assisted Rehabilitation of Hand by Paralysis of the Upper Limb After Stroke
SUMMARY:
      The investigators evaluate the effectiveness of the application of continuous passive motion
      device for hand rehabilitation in two classes of patients: with a residual active motion and
      without a residual active motion.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      We will conduct a double blind clinical trial. A sample size calculation were performed to
      determine the necessary number of subjects needed for this study and was based upon the
      results of a previous pilot study. All patients had functional impairments of their upper
      extremities after the stroke.

      We hypothesized that the hand-rehabilitation oriented with robotics assistance, would
      improve edema by paralysis of the upper limb even in patient without sensory pathway
      recovery.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a history of acute phase of stroke (less than 12 months post onset),

          -  first stroke episode,

          -  no history of peripheral nerve injury or musculoskeletal disease in the affected
             upper extremity,

          -  no contracture of the affected wrist or fingers (Modified Ashworth<3),

          -  no history of any invasive procedure (Botulinum toxin type A) for the treatment of
             spasticity for at least 6 months before the start of this study,

          -  for P-ROM patients, the absence of active hand movements,

          -  for the A-ROM patients, the presence of active hand movements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  unstable medical disorders,

          -  active Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS),

          -  severe spatial neglect,

          -  aphasia,

          -  cognitive problems.

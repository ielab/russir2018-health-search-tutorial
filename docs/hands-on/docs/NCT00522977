TITLE:
      Echo-Cardiographic Assessment of Cardiovascular Characteristics During Pregnancy and Postpartum Periods
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this echocardiographic study is to restudy the longitudinal changes in
      cardiac size and function during and after pregnancy in healthy women using relatively new
      parameters of systolic and diastolic function as well as classical measures of left
      ventricle (LV) function using contemporary echocardiographic machines.

      We, the researchers at Hillel Yaffe Medical Center, will assess diastolic function and its
      possible relation to shortness of breath.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      A comprehensive echocardiographic study of the heart will be conducted in the first, second
      and third trimesters of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum.

      Determination of left ventricular dimensions, transvalvular Doppler flow, ejection fraction,
      stroke volume, cardiac output, pulmonary vein flow, tissue Doppler, flow propagation, global
      and segmental strain parameters, timing of peak strain and various parameters of diastolic
      function will be obtained.

      From these data normal values for various stages of pregnancy will be determined as well as
      range for changes expected during longitudinal follow-up will be determined.

TITLE:
      Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) in Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)/Post Concussion Syndrome (PCS) and TBI/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
SUMMARY:
      This is a pilot trial to see if one or two 40 treatment courses of low pressure hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy can improve cognition and brain imaging in subjects with either chronic
      mild-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS) or
      chronic PCS with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) secondary to blast injury.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, 18-65 years old

          -  One or more mild-moderate TBI's characterized by loss of consciousness due to blast
             injury that is a minimum of one year old and occurred after 9/11/2001

          -  Absence of acute cardiac arrest or hemorrhagic shock at time of TBI.

          -  Absence of intracranial neurosurgery post-TBI

          -  Disability Rating Scale of 0-3

          -  Negative Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST)

          -  Negative Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)

          -  Negative urine toxicology screen for drugs of abuse

          -  Negative pregnancy test in females

          -  Otherwise good health

          -  Less than 90% on the Percent Back to Normal Rating Scale

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pulmonary disease that precludes HBOT

          -  Unstable medical conditions that are contraindicated in HBOT

          -  Severe confinement anxiety

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Other pre-TBI neurological diagnoses

          -  Pre or post TBI history of substance abuse

          -  Pre or post TBI history of alcoholism.

          -  Participation in another experimental trial with active intervention.

          -  High probability of inability to complete the experimental protocol.

          -  Previous HBOT

          -  History of hospitalization for past TBI, stroke, nonfebrile seizures, or any seizure
             history other than seizure at the time of TBI

          -  Past or current history of mental retardation (baseline FSIQ < 71.

          -  Pre/post-TBI history of systemic illness with impact on CNS (P.I.'s decision)

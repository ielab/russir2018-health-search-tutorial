TITLE:
      The Use of Mole Mapping Diagrams to Increase Skin Self Examination Accuracy
SUMMARY:
      This study aims to improve Skin Self-Examination accuracy by a simple cost effective
      intervention requiring participants to complete a mole-mapping diagram.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects above age 18 of any ethnicity will be enrolled in this
             study.

TITLE:
      A Prospective, Randomised Long-term Follow-up of Operative Versus Non-operative Treatment of Gr. 3 Acromioclavicular Dislocation
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to compare the long-term clinical and radiological results of
      operative and conservative treatment of Tossy type 3 acromio-clavicular dislocation.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The optimal treatment of Rockwood type 3 AC joint injuries is still controversial. This
      controversy results from the low level of evidence of the early literature and the
      evaluation of all AC joint injuries with a type I through III classification system.

      There are no prospective randomized controlled long-term studies on the treatment of Tossy
      type 3 AC dislocation using primary repair and minimal pin fixation.

      In this study, the non-surgical treatment consisted of immobilisation of the injured
      AC-joint in a Kenny-Howard-type splint for four weeks. The surgical treatment consisted of
      an open reduction and fixation of the AC joint with two smooth Kirschner wires (2 mm in
      diameter) across the AC-joint. The K-wires were bent at the proximal ends, with suturing of
      the superior AC ligament.

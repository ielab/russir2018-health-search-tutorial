TITLE:
      Improving Hand Use in Multiple Sclerosis
SUMMARY:
      This study will compare two different kinds of physical therapy to improve use of the hands
      in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). One treatment will be Constraint-Induced
      Movement therapy (CI therapy), the other will be a set of Complementary and Alternative
      Medicine (CAM) treatments (yoga, relaxation exercises, aquatherapy, massage). The study will
      determine which of the two forms of treatment is more successful for improving hand use.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) frequently causes reduced use of one of the hands, and as a result,
      much of daily living activities are conducted only by the other hand, leaving the person
      effective one-handed. Nonetheless, reduced hand use can be improved for extended amounts of
      time with specific forms of physical therapy, as long as persons with MS have the ability to
      perform the training tasks.

      This study will randomize persons with MS who have relatively reduced use of one of the
      hands to either CI therapy or CAM treatments. Treatment in either program will be for 2
      consecutive weeks, 3.5 hours per day (Monday-Friday), under the direct supervision of a
      specially trained therapist. Before starting, participants will also undergo comprehensive
      medical and physical exam screening and brain MRI scan. The same evaluations will be
      performed after treatment to learn whether any of these have changed as a result of
      treatment.

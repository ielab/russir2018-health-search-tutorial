TITLE:
      Clinical Predictors of Pediatric OSAHS
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to develop adequate and satisfactory tools using reliable
      clinical and physical factors in predicting pediatric obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea
      syndrome (OSAHS) and allow greater access to appropriate therapy in children.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The prevalence of OSAHS is estimated to be about 1% to 4% in children, however, it is
      frequently underdiagnosed because of the difficulties for evaluation.Current diagnostic
      approaches are based on the patient's history, clinical presentation and physical
      examination, endoscopy, and radiological imaging examinations, and confirmation is made by
      the current gold standard of full-night polysomnography (PSG). Previous studies have
      reported the use of a clinical history, physical examination and questionnaires for
      predicting pediatric OSAHS but there were lacking of adequate and satisfactory results.
      Despite the potential diagnostic benefits, PSG for pediatric patients are not routinely used
      in clinical practice. Therefore, to obtain a reliable, valid, and easily-performed
      diagnostic or screening tool for the clinical assessment of pediatric OSAHS is essential for
      the cost-effective care of these patients.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children (younger than 18 years old and older than 2 years old) with symptoms of
             snoring and then were confirmed to having obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome
             by a comprehensive polysomnography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with substance abuse problems or the long-term usage of medications known to
             affect sleep, craniofacial abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, Down syndrome,
             cerebral palsy, mucopolysaccharidoses, Prader-Willi syndrome, history of psychosis,
             central sleep apnea syndrome, or previous airway surgery including tonsillectomy
             and/or adenoidectomy were excluded from the study.

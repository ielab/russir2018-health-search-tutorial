TITLE:
      LigaSure Small Jaw® Versus Conventional Neck Dissection in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
SUMMARY:
      There were totally 41 patients enrolled in the end of the study. The study group consisted
      of 20 patients while the control group had 21 patients. The operation duration was shorter
      (97.1 versus 116.3 minutes, P = 0.022) and the average amount of injected analgesics was
      lower (8.8 versus 17.7 ampules, P = 0.037) in the study group. No significant differences
      were noted between the two groups in demographic variables, primary tumor site, clinical N
      stage, levels of neck dissection, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative drainage
      amount/duration, and subjective postoperative pain status.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      We compared the differences in perioperative and postoperative variables between LigaSure
      Small Jaw®-assisted and conventional neck dissection in head and neck cancer patients.

      Patients who were scheduled to undergo neck dissection due to head and neck cancer were
      eligible for this study. After receiving a detailed explanation, all patients signed an
      informed consent form before randomization. The study group were treated using the LigaSure
      vessel sealing system (Small Jaw®; Covidien, Colorado, USA) for dissection and hemostasis
      throughout the whole procedures during neck dissection. Relevant data included tumor-related
      variables, perioperative parameters, postoperative drainage status, postoperative subjective
      pain, and analgesic consumption amount were recorded and analyzed.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 20 to 80 years scheduled to receive neck dissection due to head and
             neck cancer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of coagulation disorders

          -  prior radiation to the neck

          -  prior neck dissection

          -  declined to participate

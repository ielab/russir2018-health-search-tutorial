TITLE:
      Lapatinib in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel in Patients With ErbB2 Amplified Advanced Gastric Cancer
SUMMARY:
      EGF104578 is two-part study (Pilot part/Randomized part).Pilot part is designed to find the
      optimal (best) doses of lapatinib and paclitaxel when given together,Randomized part is
      designed to evaluate the overall survival in patients receiving lapatinib and paclitaxel
      compared to patients receiving only paclitaxel.

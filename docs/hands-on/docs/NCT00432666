TITLE:
      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Post-stroke Spasticity of the Upper Limb
SUMMARY:
      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) is a botulinum toxin type A preparation free from complexing
      proteins, i.e. free from proteins other than the active toxin. Injected into the muscle,
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) causes local weakening. Botulinum toxin type A is widely used
      for treatment of various neurological conditions. This study will investigate the efficacy
      and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity of the
      upper limb.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male patients ≥ 18 years

          -  ≥ 6 months since the last stroke, diagnosed by an appropriate health care
             professional (e.g., neurologist)

          -  Focal spasticity with ≥ 2 points on the Ashworth Scale in the wrist flexors with
             clinical pattern Flexed Wrist

          -  Focal spasticity with ≥ 2 points on the Ashworth Scale in the fingers flexors with
             clinical pattern Clenched Fist

          -  For pre-treated patients only: source documentation of the most recent injection
             session with Botulinum Toxin and sufficient therapeutic response for Flexed Wrist and
             Clenched Fist

          -  For pre-treated patients only: the most recent injection with Botulinum Toxin must
             have been maximal 50 Units BOTOX® or 200 Units Dysport® or 2000 Units Neurobloc®
             (type B preparation) per each of these flexors: carpi ulnaris, digitorum
             superficialis, digitorum profundus

          -  For pre-treated patients only: the most recent injection with Botulinum Toxin must
             have been maximal 60 Units BOTOX® or 240 Units Dysport® or 2400 Units Neurobloc®
             (type B preparation) for flexor carpi radialis

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Spasticity of any other origin than stroke

          -  Previous treatment with Botulinum Toxin of any serotype and for any body region
             within the 4 months prior to Screening (Visit 1, Day -7)

          -  Planned concomitant treatment with Botulinum Toxin of any serotype and for any body
             region

          -  Previous or planned treatment with phenol- or alcohol-injection in the target limb

          -  Previous surgical treatment of spasticity in the target muscle(s)

          -  Fixed contracture, defined as severe restriction of the range of joint movement on
             passive stretch

          -  Severe atrophy of the target limb muscles

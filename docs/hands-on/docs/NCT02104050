TITLE:
      Study of OLT1177 Gel to Treat Moderate to Severe OA Knee Pain
SUMMARY:
      The objectives of this trial are to investigate the efficacy and safety of six weeks of
      treatment with OLT1177 Gel in subjects with moderate to severe pain associated with
      osteoarthritis of the knee following cessation of pain therapy.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 45 to 80 years old, inclusive

          -  Clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis in one target knee based on the following
             American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria:

               1. Knee Pain

               2. At least 1 of 3:

                    -  Age > 50 years

               3. Osteophytes on radiograph

          -  Symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee (including pain) for ≥ 6 months
             prior to Screening

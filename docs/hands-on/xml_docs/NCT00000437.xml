      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of naltrexone (Revia) in
      reducing drinking and smoking in patients with both nicotine and alcohol dependence.

      Individuals will be randomly assigned to a 12-week trial of a fixed daily dose of either
      naltrexone (Revia) and nicotine replacement patch or placebos. All individuals will receive
      weekly coping skills and smoking-cessation behavioral therapy. Followup interviews will be
      conducted 3 and 6 months after treatment to determine smoking and drinking status and
      persistence of any dependence symptoms.

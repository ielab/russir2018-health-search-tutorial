      The study's purpose is to improve alcoholism treatment by investigating the combined
      effectiveness of a psychotherapy (Coping Skills Training and Cue Exposure Treatment -
      CSTCET) with naltrexone in a randomized clinical trial. Individuals will receive 2 weeks of
      CSTCET or a control treatment as inpatients followed by 12 consecutive weeks of receiving

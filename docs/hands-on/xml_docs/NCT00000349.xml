    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical safety issues pertaining to flupenthixol,
      to cocaine, and to their interaction, and to determine how pretreatment with flupenthixol
      modifies the subjective as well as physiological effects of cocaine. Taken together, these
      relatively D-1 selective agents can help determine the extent to which DA-1 binding affects
      the reinforcing effects of stimulants.

      BACKGROUND:

      This grant-supported, cooperative, fixed-protocol clinical study was initiated in 1966 and
      followed a cooperative study of the treatment of renal hypertension initiated in 1960 to
      evaluate the relative efficacy of several recognized drug regimens for reduction of blood
      pressure. Six centers (USPHS hospitals) and a coordinating center were involved in the
      trial.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind, fixed sample. Three hundred and eighty nine eligible patients were
      assigned to drug therapy consisting of chlorothiazide plus Rauwolfia serpentina or to
      placebo.

      The study completion date listed in this record was inferred from last publication listed in
      the Citations section of this study record.

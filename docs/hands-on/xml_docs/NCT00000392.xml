  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the chemical efficacy and safety of intranasally administered peptide T on
      neurocognitive function in HIV seropositive individuals.

      Previous studies have shown that treatment with peptide T can result in cognitive
      improvement in HIV-infected patients.

      Patients are randomized to receive either peptide T or placebo for the first 6 months. All
      patients then receive open-label peptide T for approximately 6 additional months.
      Neuropsychologic tests are used to determine drug effects.

               1. Inhaled aerosolized pentamidine for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis,
                  dapsone, cotrimoxazole, topical antifungal agents, nystatin or ketoconazole,
                  acyclovir.

               2. Amitriptyline (up to 50 mg/day) or an equivalent dose of another antidepressant
                  for relief of peripheral neuropathy that is expected to remain unchanged
                  throughout the first 6 months of the study.

             HIV-related symptoms. ( 0 - 100 - 200 - 300 - 400 - 500 - 600 - 700 - 800 plus.)

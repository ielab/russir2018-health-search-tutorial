  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the neurophysiologic indicators of cocaine or
      methamphetamine use and withdrawal, to examine the relationship between subjects' reports of
      depression, craving, and stimulant use, and neurophysiologic measures, and to identify
      neurophysiologic measures which can be used to identify new treatments for stimulant
      dependence.

      By Incorporating QEEG into clinical trails, the plan is to develop physiologic markers of
      treatment efficacy, and to aid in the identification of effective treatments.

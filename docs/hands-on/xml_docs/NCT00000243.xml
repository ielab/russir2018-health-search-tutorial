  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is a drug that may be helpful in treating opioid dependent individuals who
      were previously maintained on methadone. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effects of different doses of buprenorphine/naloxone in treating opioid dependent
      individuals who were previously maintained on methadone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid that is being developed as a treatment
      for opioid dependence. Because buprenorphine is a partial mu agonist opioid, under certain
      conditions it is possible for buprenorphine to precipitate opioid withdrawal in opioid
      dependent individuals. A person with a high level of physical dependence could experience
      buprenorphine-related precipitated withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to test the
      acute effects of different doses of buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid dependent individuals
      maintained on methadone. The study is designed to provide dosing schedules similar to those
      that might be initially used in a physician's office.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity in children is reaching epidemic proportions. Excess adiposity is
      more than just a cosmetic problem, having substantial metabolic consequences. Insulin
      resistance, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and frank diabetes are often seen
      in obese children. In this study the prevalence of impaired glucose (carbohydrate) tolerance
      in lean children with a family history of diabetes and obese children with acanthosis
      nigricans with or without a family history of diabetes mellitus will be studied.

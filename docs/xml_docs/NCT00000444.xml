      This study will attempt to determine the best time to begin a smoking cessation program in
      individuals who undergo intensive treatment for alcohol dependence. The goal of this trial
      is to determine whether a smoking cessation program is more effective if it occurs at the
      same time as or after treatment for alcohol dependence. The study also will attempt to
      determine the effect of smoking cessation programs on the outcome of treatment for alcohol
      dependence.

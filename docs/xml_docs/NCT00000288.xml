      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of varying doses of cotinine on
      cigarette self-administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, antagonizes some of the
      effects of nicotine. One study showed that nicotine eliminates some of the beneficial
      effects of the nicotine patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study was
      to examine the effects of cotinine. The results generally showed no effects on
      self-administration of cigarettes, although higher serum nicotine levels were observed on
      the highest doses of cotinine compared to placebo or lower doses of cotinine.
